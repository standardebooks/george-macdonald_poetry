			<h2 epub:type="title">To My Father</h2>
I.

Take of the first fruits, Father, of thy care,
  Wrapped in the fresh leaves of my gratitude
  Late waked for early gifts ill understood;
Claiming in all my harvests rightful share,
Whether with song that mounts the joyful air
  I praise my God; or, in yet deeper mood,
  Sit dumb because I know a speechless good,
Needing no voice, but all the soul for prayer.
  Thou hast been faithful to my highest need;
And I, thy debtor, ever, evermore,
Shall never feel the grateful burden sore.
  Yet most I thank thee, not for any deed,
  But for the sense thy living self did breed
That fatherhood is at the great world's core.


II.

All childhood, reverence clothed thee, undefined,
  As for some being of another race;
  Ah! not with it departing--grown apace
As years have brought me manhood's loftier mind
Able to see thy human life behind--
  The same hid heart, the same revealing face--
  My own dim contest settling into grace
Of sorrow, strife, and victory combined.
  So I beheld my God, in childhood's morn,
A mist, a darkness, great, and far apart,
Moveless and dim--I scarce could say _Thou art_:
  My manhood came, of joy and sadness born--
  Full soon the misty dark, asunder torn,
Revealed man's glory, God's great human heart.

G.M.D. Jr.

			<h2 epub:type="title">A Hidden Life</h2>
<p id="id01067">  Proudly the youth, sudden with manhood crowned,<br/>

  Went walking by his horses, the first time,<br/>

  That morning, to the plough. No soldier gay<br/>

  Feels at his side the throb of the gold hilt<br/>

  (Knowing the blue blade hides within its sheath,<br/>

  As lightning in the cloud) with more delight,<br/>

  When first he belts it on, than he that day<br/>

  Heard still the clank of the plough-chains against<br/>

  His horses' harnessed sides, as to the field<br/>

  They went to make it fruitful. O'er the hill<br/>

  The sun looked down, baptizing him for toil.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01068">  A farmer's son, a farmer's grandson he;<br/>

  Yea, his great-grandsire had possessed those fields.<br/>

  Tradition said they had been tilled by men<br/>

  Who bore the name long centuries ago,<br/>

  And married wives, and reared a stalwart race,<br/>

  And died, and went where all had followed them,<br/>

  Save one old man, his daughter, and the youth<br/>

  Who ploughs in pride, nor ever doubts his toil;<br/>

  And death is far from him this sunny morn.<br/>

  Why should we think of death when life is high?<br/>

  The earth laughs all the day, and sleeps all night.<br/>

  The daylight's labour and the night's repose<br/>

  Are very good, each better in its time.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01069">  The boy knew little; but he read old tales<br/>

  Of Scotland's warriors, till his blood ran swift<br/>

  As charging knights upon their death-career.<br/>

  He chanted ancient tunes, till the wild blood<br/>

  Was charmed back into its fountain-well,<br/>

  And tears arose instead. That poet's songs,<br/>

  Whose music evermore recalls his name,<br/>

  His name of waters babbling as they run,<br/>

  Rose from him in the fields among the kine,<br/>

  And met the skylark's, raining from the clouds.<br/>

  But only as the poet-birds he sang—<br/>

  From rooted impulse of essential song;<br/>

  The earth was fair—he knew not it was fair;<br/>

  His heart was glad—he knew not it was glad;<br/>

  He walked as in a twilight of the sense—<br/>

  Which this one day shall turn to tender morn.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01070">  Long ere the sun had cleared the feathery tops<br/>

  Of the fir-thicket on the eastward hill,<br/>

  His horses leaned and laboured. Each great hand<br/>

  Held rein and plough-stilt in one guiding grasp—<br/>

  No ploughman there would brook a helper. Proud<br/>

  With a true ploughman's pride—nobler, I think,<br/>

  Than statesman's, ay, or poet's, or painter's pride,<br/>

  For little praise will come that he ploughs well—<br/>

  He did plough well, proud of his work itself,<br/>

  And not of what would follow. With sure eye,<br/>

  He saw his horses keep the arrow-track;<br/>

  He saw the swift share cut the measured sod;<br/>

  He saw the furrow folding to the right,<br/>

  Ready with nimble foot to aid at need:—<br/>

  Turning its secrets upward to the sun,<br/>

  And hiding in the dark the sun-born grass,<br/>

  And daisies dipped in carmine, lay the tilth—<br/>

  A million graves to nurse the buried seed,<br/>

  And send a golden harvest up the air.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01071">  When the steep sun had clomb to his decline,<br/>

  And pausing seemed, at edge of slow descent,<br/>

  Upon the keystone of his airy bridge,<br/>

  They rested likewise, half-tired man and horse,<br/>

  And homeward went for food and courage new.<br/>

  Therewith refreshed, they turned again to toil,<br/>

  And lived in labour all the afternoon;<br/>

  Till, in the gloaming, once again the plough<br/>

  Lay like a stranded bark upon the lea,<br/>

  And home with hanging neck the horses went,<br/>

  Walking beside their master, force by will:<br/>

  Then through the lengthening shades a vision came.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01072">  It was a lady mounted on a horse,<br/>

  A slender girl upon a mighty steed,<br/>

  That bore her with the pride horses must feel<br/>

  When they submit to women. Home she went,<br/>

  Alone, or else her groom lagged far behind.<br/>

  Scarce had she bent simple acknowledgment<br/>

  Of the hand in silent salutation lifted<br/>

  To the bowed head, when something faithless yielded:<br/>

  The saddle slipped, the horse stopped, and the girl<br/>

  Stood on her feet, still holding fast the reins.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01073">  Three paces bore him bounding to her side;<br/>

  Her radiant beauty almost fixed him there;<br/>

  But with main force, as one that grapples fear,<br/>

  He threw the fascination off, and saw<br/>

  The work before him. Soon his hand and knife<br/>

  Had set the saddle firmer than before<br/>

  Upon the gentle horse; and then he turned<br/>

  To mount the maiden. But bewilderment<br/>

  A moment lasted; for he knew not how,<br/>

  With stirrup-hand and steady arm, to throne,<br/>

  Elastic, on her steed, the ascending maid:<br/>

  A moment only; for while yet she thanked,<br/>

  Nor yet had time to teach her further will,<br/>

  About her waist he put his brawny hands,<br/>

  That all but zoned her round; and like a child<br/>

  Lifting her high, he set her on the horse;<br/>

  Whence like a risen moon she smiled on him,<br/>

  Nor turned aside, although a radiant blush<br/>

  Shone in her cheek, and shadowed in her eyes.<br/>

  And he was never sure if from her heart<br/>

  Or from the rosy sunset came the flush.<br/>

  Again she thanked him, while again he stood<br/>

  Bewildered in her beauty. Not a word<br/>

  Answered her words that flowed, folded in tones<br/>

  Round which dissolving lambent music played,<br/>

  Like dropping water in a silver cup;<br/>

  Till, round the shoulder of the neighbouring hill,<br/>

  Sudden she disappeared. And he awoke,<br/>

  And called himself hard names, and turned and went<br/>

  After his horses, bending like them his head.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01074">  Ah God! when Beauty passes from the door,<br/>

  Although she came not in, the house is bare:<br/>

  Shut, shut the door; there's nothing in the house!<br/>

  Why seems it always that she should be ours?<br/>

  A secret lies behind which thou dost know,<br/>

  And I can partly guess.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01075">                         But think not then,<br/>

  The holder of the plough sighed many sighs<br/>

  Upon his bed that night; or other dreams<br/>

  Than pleasant rose upon his view in sleep;<br/>

  Nor think the airy castles of his brain<br/>

  Had less foundation than the air admits.<br/>

  But read my simple tale, scarce worth the name,<br/>

  And answer, if he had not from the fair<br/>

  Beauty's best gift; and proved her not, in sooth,<br/>

  An angel vision from a higher world.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01076">  Not much of her I tell. Her glittering life,<br/>

  Where part the waters on the mountain-ridge,<br/>

  Ran down the southern side, away from his.<br/>

  It was not over-blessed; for, I know,<br/>

  Its tale wiled many sighs, one summer eve,<br/>

  From her who told, and him who, in the pines<br/>

  Walking, received it from her loving lips;<br/>

  But now she was as God had made her, ere<br/>

  The world had tried to spoil her; tried, I say,<br/>

  And half succeeded, failing utterly.<br/>

  Fair was she, frank, and innocent as a child<br/>

  That looks in every eye; fearless of ill,<br/>

  Because she knew it not; and brave withal,<br/>

  Because she led a simple country life,<br/>

  And loved the animals. Her father's house—<br/>

  A Scottish laird was he, of ancient name—<br/>

  Was distant but two miles among the hills;<br/>

  Yet oft as she had passed his father's farm,<br/>

  The youth had never seen her face before,<br/>

  And should not twice. Yet was it not enough?<br/>

  The vision tarried. She, as the harvest moon<br/>

  That goeth on her way, and knoweth not<br/>

  The fields of corn whose ripening grain she fills<br/>

  With strength of life, and hope, and joy for men,<br/>

  Went on her way, and knew not of the virtue<br/>

  Gone out of her; yea, never thought of him,<br/>

  Save at such times when, all at once, old scenes<br/>

  Return uncalled, with wonder that they come.<br/>

  Soon was she orphaned of her sheltering hills,<br/>

  And rounded with dead glitter, not the shine<br/>

  Of leaves and waters dancing in the sun;<br/>

  While he abode in ever breaking dawns,<br/>

  Breathed ever new-born winds into his soul;<br/>

  And saw the aurora of the heavenly day<br/>

  Still climb the hill-sides of the heapy world.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01077">  Again I say, no fond romance of love,<br/>

  No argument of possibilities,<br/>

  If he were some one, and she sought his help,<br/>

  Turned his clear brain into a nest of dreams.<br/>

  As soon he had sat down and twisted cords<br/>

  To snare, and carry home for household help,<br/>

  Some woman-angel, wandering half-seen<br/>

  On moonlight wings, o'er withered autumn fields.<br/>

  But when he rose next morn, and went abroad,<br/>

  (The exultation of his new-found rank<br/>

  Already settling into dignity,)<br/>

  Behold, the earth was beautiful! The sky<br/>

  Shone with the expectation of the sun.<br/>

  Only the daisies grieved him, for they fell<br/>

  Caught in the furrow, with their innocent heads<br/>

  Just out, imploring. A gray hedgehog ran,<br/>

  With tangled mesh of rough-laid spikes, and face<br/>

  Helplessly innocent, across the field:<br/>

  He let it run, and blessed it as it ran.<br/>

  Returned at noon-tide, something drew his feet<br/>

  Into the barn: entering, he gazed and stood.<br/>

  For, through the rent roof lighting, one sunbeam<br/>

  Blazed on the yellow straw one golden spot,<br/>

  Dulled all the amber heap, and sinking far,<br/>

  Like flame inverted, through the loose-piled mound,<br/>

  Crossed the keen splendour with dark shadow-straws,<br/>

  In lines innumerable. 'Twas so bright,<br/>

  His eye was cheated with a spectral smoke<br/>

  That rose as from a fire. He had not known<br/>

  How beautiful the sunlight was, not even<br/>

  Upon the windy fields of morning grass,<br/>

  Nor on the river, nor the ripening corn!<br/>

  As if to catch a wild live thing, he crept<br/>

  On tiptoe silent, laid him on the heap,<br/>

  And gazing down into the glory-gulf,<br/>

  Dreamed as a boy half sleeping by the fire—<br/>

  Half dreaming rose, and got his horses out.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01078">  God, and not woman, is the heart of all.<br/>

  But she, as priestess of the visible earth,<br/>

  Holding the key, herself most beautiful,<br/>

  Had come to him, and flung the portals wide.<br/>

  He entered: every beauty was a glass<br/>

  That gleamed the woman back upon his view.<br/>

  Shall I not rather say: each beauty gave<br/>

  Its own soul up to him who worshipped her,<br/>

  For that his eyes were opened now to see?<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01079">  Already in these hours his quickened soul<br/>

  Put forth the white tip of a floral bud,<br/>

  Ere long to be a crown-like, aureole flower.<br/>

  His songs unbidden, his joy in ancient tales,<br/>

  Had hitherto alone betrayed the seed<br/>

  That lay in his heart, close hidden even from him,<br/>

  Yet not the less mellowing all his spring:<br/>

  Like summer sunshine came the maiden's face,<br/>

  And in the youth's glad heart the seed awoke.<br/>

  It grew and spread, and put forth many flowers,<br/>

  Its every flower a living open eye,<br/>

  Until his soul was full of eyes within.<br/>

  Each morning now was a fresh boon to him;<br/>

  Each wind a spiritual power upon his life;<br/>

  Each individual animal did share<br/>

  A common being with him; every kind<br/>

  Of flower from every other was distinct,<br/>

  Uttering that for which alone it was—<br/>

  Its something human, wrapt in other veil.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01080">  And when the winter came, when thick the snow<br/>

  Armed the sad fields from gnawing of the frost,<br/>

  When the low sun but skirted his far realms,<br/>

  And sank in early night, he drew his chair<br/>

  Beside the fire; and by the feeble lamp<br/>

  Read book on book; and wandered other climes,<br/>

  And lived in other lives and other needs,<br/>

  And grew a larger self by other selves.<br/>

  Ere long, the love of knowledge had become<br/>

  A hungry passion and a conscious power,<br/>

  And craved for more than reading could supply.<br/>

  Then, through the night (all dark, except the moon<br/>

  Shone frosty o'er the heath, or the white snow<br/>

  Gave back such motes of light as else had sunk<br/>

  In the dark earth) he bent his plodding way<br/>

  Over the moors to where the little town<br/>

  Lay gathered in the hollow. There the student<br/>

  Who taught from lingering dawn to early dark,<br/>

  Had older scholars in the long fore-night;<br/>

  For youths who in the shop, or in the barn,<br/>

  Or at the loom, had done their needful work,<br/>

  Came gathering there through starlight, fog, or snow,<br/>

  And found the fire ablaze, the candles lit,<br/>

  And him who knew waiting for who would know.<br/>

  Here mathematics wiled him to their heights;<br/>

  And strange consent of lines to form and law<br/>

  Made Euclid a profound romance of truth.<br/>

  The master saw with wonder how he seized,<br/>

  How eagerly devoured the offered food,<br/>

  And longed to give him further kinds. For Knowledge<br/>

  Would multiply like Life; and two clear souls<br/>

  That see a truth, and, turning, see at once<br/>

  Each the other's face glow in that truth's delight,<br/>

  Are drawn like lovers. So the master offered<br/>

  To guide the ploughman through the narrow ways<br/>

  To heights of Roman speech. The youth, alert,<br/>

  Caught at the offer; and for years of nights,<br/>

  The house asleep, he groped his twilight way<br/>

  With lexicon and rule, through ancient story,<br/>

  Or fable fine, embalmed in Latin old;<br/>

  Wherein his knowledge of the English tongue,<br/>

  Through reading many books, much aided him—<br/>

  For best is like in all the hearts and tongues.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01081">  At length his progress, through the master's pride<br/>

  In such a pupil, reached the father's ears.<br/>

  Great gladness woke within him, and he vowed,<br/>

  If caring, sparing might accomplish it,<br/>

  He should to college, and there have his fill<br/>

  Of that same learning.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01082">                       To the plough no more,<br/>

  All day to school he went; and ere a year,<br/>

  He wore the scarlet gown with the closed sleeves.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01083">  Awkward at first, but with a dignity<br/>

  Soon finding fit embodiment in speech<br/>

  And gesture and address, he made his way,<br/>

  Unconscious all, to the full-orbed respect<br/>

  Of students and professors; for whose praise<br/>

  More than his worth, society, so called,<br/>

  To its rooms in that great city of the North,<br/>

  Invited him. He entered. Dazzled at first<br/>

  By brilliance of the shining show, the lights,<br/>

  The mirrors, gems, white necks, and radiant eyes,<br/>

  He stole into a corner, and was quiet<br/>

  Until the vision too had quieter grown.<br/>

  Bewildered next by many a sparkling word,<br/>

  Nor knowing the light-play of polished minds,<br/>

  Which, like rose-diamonds cut in many facets,<br/>

  Catch and reflect the wandering rays of truth<br/>

  As if they were home-born and issuing new,<br/>

  He held his peace, and silent soon began<br/>

  To see how little fire it needs to shimmer.<br/>

  Hence, in the midst of talk, his thoughts would wander<br/>

  Back to the calm divine of homely toil;<br/>

  While round him still and ever hung an air<br/>

  Of breezy fields, and plough, and cart, and scythe—<br/>

  A kind of clumsy grace, in which gay girls<br/>

  Saw but the clumsiness—another sort<br/>

  Saw the grace too, yea, sometimes, when he spoke,<br/>

  Saw the grace only; and began at last,<br/>

  For he sought none, to seek him in the crowd,<br/>

  And find him unexpected, maiden-wise.<br/>

  But oftener far they sought him than they found,<br/>

  For seldom was he drawn away from toil;<br/>

  Seldomer stinted time held due to toil;<br/>

  For if one night his panes were dark, the next<br/>

  They gleamed far into morning. And he won<br/>

  Honours among the first, each session's close.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01084">  Nor think that new familiarity<br/>

  With open forms of ill, not to be shunned<br/>

  Where many youths are met, endangered much<br/>

  A mind that had begun to will the pure.<br/>

  Oft when the broad rich humour of a jest<br/>

  With breezy force drew in its skirts a troop<br/>

  Of pestilential vapours following—<br/>

  Arose within his sudden silent mind<br/>

  The maiden face that once blushed down on him—<br/>

  That lady face, insphered beyond his earth,<br/>

  Yet visible as bright, particular star.<br/>

  A flush of tenderness then glowed across<br/>

  His bosom—shone it clean from passing harm:<br/>

  Should that sweet face be banished by rude words?<br/>

  It could not stay what maidens might not hear!<br/>

  He almost wept for shame, that face, such jest,<br/>

  Should meet in <i>his</i> house. To his love he made<br/>

  Love's only worthy offering—purity.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01085">  And if the homage that he sometimes met,<br/>

  New to the country lad, conveyed in smiles,<br/>

  Assents, and silent listenings when he spoke,<br/>

  Threatened yet more his life's simplicity;<br/>

  An antidote of nature ever came,<br/>

  Even Nature's self. For, in the summer months,<br/>

  His former haunts and boyhood's circumstance<br/>

  Received him to the bosom of their grace.<br/>

  And he, too noble to despise the past,<br/>

  Too proud to be ashamed of manly toil,<br/>

  Too wise to fancy that a gulf gaped wide<br/>

  Betwixt the labouring hand and thinking brain,<br/>

  Or that a workman was no gentleman<br/>

  Because a workman, clothed himself again<br/>

  In his old garments, took the hoe, the spade,<br/>

  The sowing sheet, or covered in the grain,<br/>

  Smoothing with harrows what the plough had ridged.<br/>

  With ever fresher joy he hailed the fields,<br/>

  Returning still with larger powers of sight:<br/>

  Each time he knew them better than before,<br/>

  And yet their sweetest aspect was the old.<br/>

  His labour kept him true to life and fact,<br/>

  Casting out worldly judgments, false desires,<br/>

  And vain distinctions. Ever, at his toil,<br/>

  New thoughts would rise, which, when God's night awoke,<br/>

  He still would seek, like stars, with instruments—<br/>

  By science, or by truth's philosophy,<br/>

  Bridging the gulf betwixt the new and old.<br/>

  Thus laboured he with hand and brain at once,<br/>

  Nor missed due readiness when Scotland's sons<br/>

  Met to reap wisdom, and the fields were white.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01086">  His sire was proud of him; and, most of all,<br/>

  Because his learning did not make him proud:<br/>

  He was too wise to build upon his lore.<br/>

  The neighbours asked what he would make his son:<br/>

  "I'll make a man of him," the old man said;<br/>

  "And for the rest, just what he likes himself.<br/>

  He is my only son—I think he'll keep<br/>

  The old farm on; and I shall go content,<br/>

  Leaving a man behind me, as I say."<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01087">  So four years long his life swung to and fro,<br/>

  Alternating the red gown and blue coat,<br/>

  The garret study and the wide-floored barn,<br/>

  The wintry city and the sunny fields:<br/>

  In every change his mind was well content,<br/>

  For in himself he was the growing same.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01088">  In no one channel flowed his seeking thoughts;<br/>

  To no profession did he ardent turn:<br/>

  He knew his father's wish—it was his own.<br/>

  "Why should a man," he said, "when knowledge grows,<br/>

  Leave therefore the old patriarchal life,<br/>

  And seek distinction in the noise of men?"<br/>

  He turned his asking face on every side;<br/>

  Went reverent with the anatomist, and saw<br/>

  The inner form of man laid skilful bare;<br/>

  Went with the chymist, whose wise-questioning hand<br/>

  Made Nature do in little, before his eyes,<br/>

  And momently, what, huge, for centuries,<br/>

  And in the veil of vastness and lone deeps,<br/>

  She labours at; bent his inquiring eye<br/>

  On every source whence knowledge flows for men:<br/>

  At some he only sipped, at others drank.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01089">  At length, when he had gained the master's right—<br/>

  By custom sacred from of old—to sit<br/>

  With covered head before the awful rank<br/>

  Of black-gowned senators; and each of those,<br/>

  Proud of the scholar, was ready at a word<br/>

  To speed him onward to what goal he would,<br/>

  He took his books, his well-worn cap and gown,<br/>

  And, leaving with a sigh the ancient walls,<br/>

  Crowned with their crown of stone, unchanging gray<br/>

  In all the blandishments of youthful spring,<br/>

  Chose for his world the lone ancestral farm.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01090">  With simple gladness met him on the road<br/>

  His gray-haired father—elder brother now.<br/>

  Few words were spoken, little welcome said,<br/>

  But, as they walked, the more was understood.<br/>

  If with a less delight he brought him home<br/>

  Than he who met the prodigal returned,<br/>

  It was with more reliance, with more peace;<br/>

  For with the leaning pride that old men feel<br/>

  In young strong arms that draw their might from them,<br/>

  He led him to the house. His sister there,<br/>

  Whose kisses were not many, but whose eyes<br/>

  Were full of watchfulness and hovering love,<br/>

  Set him beside the fire in the old place,<br/>

  And heaped the table with best country-fare.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01091">  When the swift night grew deep, the father rose,<br/>

  And led him, wondering why and where they went,<br/>

  Thorough the limpid dark, by tortuous path<br/>

  Between the corn-ricks, to a loft above<br/>

  The stable, where the same old horses slept<br/>

  Which he had guided that eventful morn.<br/>

  Entering, he saw a change-pursuing hand<br/>

  Had been at work. The father, leading on<br/>

  Across the floor, heaped high with store of grain<br/>

  Opened a door. An unexpected light<br/>

  Flashed on him cheerful from a fire and lamp,<br/>

  That burned alone, as in a fairy-tale:<br/>

  Behold! a little room, a curtained bed,<br/>

  An easy chair, bookshelves, and writing-desk;<br/>

  An old print of a deep Virgilian wood,<br/>

  And one of choosing Hercules! The youth<br/>

  Gazed and spoke not. The old paternal love<br/>

  Had sought and found an incarnation new!<br/>

  For, honouring in his son the simple needs<br/>

  Which his own bounty had begot in him,<br/>

  He gave him thus a lonely thinking space,<br/>

  A silent refuge. With a quiet good night,<br/>

  He left him dumb with love. Faintly beneath,<br/>

  The horses stamped, and drew the lengthening chain.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01092">  Three sliding years, with slowly blended change,<br/>

  Drew round their winter, summer, autumn, spring,<br/>

  Fulfilled of work by hands, and brain, and heart.<br/>

  He laboured as before; though when he would,<br/>

  And Nature urged not, he, with privilege,<br/>

  Would spare from hours of toil—read in his room,<br/>

  Or wander through the moorland to the hills;<br/>

  There on the apex of the world would stand,<br/>

  As on an altar, burning, soul and heart—<br/>

  Himself the sacrifice of faith and prayer;<br/>

  Gaze in the face of the inviting blue<br/>

  That domed him round; ask why it should be blue;<br/>

  Pray yet again; and with love-strengthened heart<br/>

  Go down to lower things with lofty cares.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01093">  When Sundays came, the father, daughter, son<br/>

  Walked to the church across their own loved fields.<br/>

  It was an ugly church, with scarce a sign<br/>

  Of what makes English churches venerable.<br/>

  Likest a crowing cock upon a heap<br/>

  It stood—but let us say—St. Peter's cock,<br/>

  Lacking not many a holy, rousing charm<br/>

  For one with whose known self it was coeval,<br/>

  Dawning with it from darkness of the unseen!<br/>

  And its low mounds of monumental grass<br/>

  Were far more solemn than great marble tombs;<br/>

  For flesh is grass, its goodliness the flower.<br/>

  Oh, lovely is the face of green churchyard<br/>

  On sunny afternoons! The light itself<br/>

  Nestles amid the grass; and the sweet wind<br/>

  Says, <i>I am here</i>,—no more. With sun and wind<br/>

  And crowing cocks, who can believe in death?<br/>

  He, on such days, when from the church they Came,<br/>

  And through God's ridges took their thoughtful way,<br/>

  The last psalm lingering faintly in their hearts,<br/>

  Would look, inquiring where his ridge would rise;<br/>

  But when it gloomed or rained, he turned aside:<br/>

  What mattered it to him?<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01094">                          And as they walked<br/>

  Homeward, right well the father loved to hear<br/>

  The fresh rills pouring from his son's clear well.<br/>

  For the old man clung not to the old alone,<br/>

  Nor leaned the young man only to the new;<br/>

  They would the best, they sought, and followed it.<br/>

  "The Pastor fills his office well," he said,<br/>

  In homely jest; "—the Past alone he heeds!<br/>

  Honours those Jewish times as he were a Jew,<br/>

  And Christ were neither Jew nor northern man!<br/>

  He has no ear for this poor Present Hour,<br/>

  Which wanders up and down the centuries,<br/>

  Like beggar-boy roaming the wintry streets,<br/>

  With witless hand held out to passers-by;<br/>

  And yet God made the voice of its many cries.<br/>

  Mine be the work that comes first to my hand!<br/>

  The lever set, I grasp and heave withal.<br/>

  I love where I live, and let my labour flow<br/>

  Into the hollows of the neighbour-needs.<br/>

  Perhaps I like it best: I would not choose<br/>

  Another than the ordered circumstance.<br/>

  This farm is God's as much as yonder town;<br/>

  These men and maidens, kine and horses, his;<br/>

  For them his laws must be incarnated<br/>

  In act and fact, and so their world redeemed."<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01095">  Though thus he spoke at times, he spake not oft;<br/>

  Ruled chief by action: what he said, he did.<br/>

  No grief was suffered there of man or beast<br/>

  More than was need; no creature fled in fear;<br/>

  All slaying was with generous suddenness,<br/>

  Like God's benignant lightning. "For," he said,<br/>

  "God makes the beasts, and loves them dearly well—<br/>

  Better than any parent loves his child,<br/>

  It may be," would he say; for still the <i>may be</i><br/>

  Was sacred with him no less than the <i>is</i>—<br/>

  "In such humility he lived and wrought—<br/>

  Hence are they sacred. Sprung from God as we,<br/>

  They are our brethren in a lower kind,<br/>

  And in their face we see the human look."<br/>

  If any said: "Men look like animals;<br/>

  Each has his type set in the lower kind;"<br/>

  His answer was: "The animals are like men;<br/>

  Each has his true type set in the higher kind,<br/>

  Though even there only rough-hewn as yet.<br/>

  The hell of cruelty will be the ghosts<br/>

  Of the sad beasts: their crowding heads will come,<br/>

  And with encircling, slow, pain-patient eyes,<br/>

  Stare the ill man to madness."<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01096">                                 When he spoke,<br/>

  His word behind it had the force of deeds<br/>

  Unborn within him, ready to be born;<br/>

  But, like his race, he promised very slow.<br/>

  His goodness ever went before his word,<br/>

  Embodying itself unconsciously<br/>

  In understanding of the need that prayed,<br/>

  And cheerful help that would outrun the prayer.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01097">  When from great cities came the old sad news<br/>

  Of crime and wretchedness, and children sore<br/>

  With hunger, and neglect, and cruel blows,<br/>

  He would walk sadly all the afternoon,<br/>

  With head down-bent, and pondering footstep slow;<br/>

  Arriving ever at the same result—<br/>

  Concluding ever: "The best that I can do<br/>

  For the great world, is the same best I can<br/>

  For this my world. What truth may be therein<br/>

  Will pass beyond my narrow circumstance,<br/>

  In truth's own right." When a philanthropist<br/>

  Said pompously: "It is not for your gifts<br/>

  To spend themselves on common labours thus:<br/>

  You owe the world far nobler things than such;"<br/>

  He answered him: "The world is in God's hands,<br/>

  This part of it in mine. My sacred past,<br/>

  With all its loves inherited, has led<br/>

  Hither, here left me: shall I judge, arrogant,<br/>

  Primaeval godlike work in earth and air,<br/>

  Seed-time and harvest—offered fellowship<br/>

  With God in nature—unworthy of my hands?<br/>

  I know your argument—I know with grief!—<br/>

  The crowds of men, in whom a starving soul<br/>

  Cries through the windows of their hollow eyes<br/>

  For bare humanity, nay, room to grow!—<br/>

  Would I could help them! But all crowds are made<br/>

  Of individuals; and their grief and pain,<br/>

  Their thirst and hunger—all are of the one,<br/>

  Not of the many: the true, the saving power<br/>

  Enters the individual door, and thence<br/>

  Issues again in thousand influences<br/>

  Besieging other doors. I cannot throw<br/>

  A mass of good into the general midst,<br/>

  Whereof each man may seize his private share;<br/>

  And if one could, it were of lowest kind,<br/>

  Not reaching to that hunger of the soul.<br/>

  Now here I labour whole in the same spot<br/>

  Where they have known me from my childhood up<br/>

  And I know them, each individual:<br/>

  If there is power in me to help my own,<br/>

  Even of itself it flows beyond my will,<br/>

  Takes shape in commonest of common acts,<br/>

  Meets every humble day's necessity:<br/>

  —I would not always consciously do good,<br/>

  Not always work from full intent of help,<br/>

  Lest I forget the measure heaped and pressed<br/>

  And running over which they pour for me,<br/>

  And never reap the too-much of return<br/>

  In smiling trust and beams from kindly eyes.<br/>

  But in the city, with a few lame words,<br/>

  And a few wretched coins, sore-coveted,<br/>

  To mediate 'twixt my <i>cannot</i> and my <i>would</i>,<br/>

  My best attempts would never strike a root;<br/>

  My scattered corn would turn to wind-blown chaff;<br/>

  I should grow weak, might weary of my kind,<br/>

  Misunderstood the most where almost known,<br/>

  Baffled and beaten by their unbelief:<br/>

  Years could not place me where I stand this day<br/>

  High on the vantage-ground of confidence:<br/>

  I might for years toil on, and reach no man.<br/>

  Besides, to leave the thing that nearest lies,<br/>

  And choose the thing far off, more difficult—<br/>

  The act, having no touch of God in it,<br/>

  Who seeks the needy for the pure need's sake,<br/>

  Must straightway die, choked in its selfishness."<br/>

  Thus he. The world-wise schemer for the good<br/>

  Held his poor peace, and went his trackless way.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01098">  What of the vision now? the vision fair<br/>

  Sent forth to meet him, when at eve he went<br/>

  Home from his first day's ploughing? Oft he dreamed<br/>

  She passed him smiling on her stately horse;<br/>

  But never band or buckle yielded more;<br/>

  Never again his hands enthroned the maid;<br/>

  He only worshipped with his eyes, and woke.<br/>

  Nor woke he then with foolish vain regret;<br/>

  But, saying, "I have seen the beautiful,"<br/>

  Smiled with his eyes upon a flower or bird,<br/>

  Or living form, whate'er, of gentleness,<br/>

  That met him first; and all that morn, his face<br/>

  Would oftener dawn into a blossomy smile.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01099">  And ever when he read a lofty tale,<br/>

  Or when the storied leaf, or ballad old,<br/>

  Or spake or sang of woman very fair,<br/>

  Or wondrous good, he saw her face alone;<br/>

  The tale was told, the song was sung of her.<br/>

      He did not turn aside from other maids,<br/>

  But loved their faces pure and faithful eyes.<br/>

  He may have thought, "One day I wed a maid,<br/>

  And make her mine;" but never came the maid,<br/>

  Or never came the hour: he walked alone.<br/>

      Meantime how fared the lady? She had wed<br/>

  One of the common crowd: there must be ore<br/>

  For the gold grains to lie in: virgin gold<br/>

  Lies in the rock, enriching not the stone.<br/>

  She was not one who of herself could <i>be</i>;<br/>

  And she had found no heart which, tuned with hers,<br/>

  Would beat in rhythm, growing into rime.<br/>

  She read phantasmagoric tales, sans salt,<br/>

  Sans hope, sans growth; or listlessly conversed<br/>

  With phantom-visitors—ladies, not friends,<br/>

  Mere spectral forms from fashion's concave glass.<br/>

  She haunted gay assemblies, ill-content—<br/>

  Witched woods to hide in from her better self,<br/>

  And danced, and sang, and ached. What had she felt,<br/>

  If, called up by the ordered sounds and motions,<br/>

  A vision had arisen—as once, of old,<br/>

  The minstrel's art laid bare the seer's eye,<br/>

  And showed him plenteous waters in the waste;—<br/>

  If the gay dance had vanished from her sight,<br/>

  And she beheld her ploughman-lover go<br/>

  With his great stride across a lonely field,<br/>

  Under the dark blue vault ablaze with stars,<br/>

  Lifting his full eyes to the radiant roof,<br/>

  Live with our future; or had she beheld<br/>

  Him studious, with space-compelling mind<br/>

  Bent on his slate, pursue some planet's course;<br/>

  Or reading justify the poet's wrath,<br/>

  Or sage's slow conclusion?—If a voice<br/>

  Had whispered then: This man in many a dream,<br/>

  And many a waking moment of keen joy,<br/>

  Blesses you for the look that woke his heart,<br/>

  That smiled him into life, and, still undimmed,<br/>

  Lies lamping in the cabinet of his soul;—<br/>

  Would her sad eyes have beamed with sudden light?<br/>

  Would not her soul, half-dead with nothingness,<br/>

  Have risen from the couch of its unrest,<br/>

  And looked to heaven again, again believed<br/>

  In God and life, courage, and duty, and love?<br/>

  Would not her soul have sung to its lone self:<br/>

  "I have a friend, a ploughman, who is wise.<br/>

  He knows what God, and goodness, and fair faith<br/>

  Mean in the words and books of mighty men.<br/>

  He nothing heeds the show of worldly things,<br/>

  But worships the unconquerable truth.<br/>

  This man is humble and loves me: I will<br/>

  Be proud and very humble. If he knew me,<br/>

  Would he go on and love me till we meet!"?<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01100">  In the third year, a heavy harvest fell,<br/>

  Full filled, before the reaping-hook and scythe.<br/>

  The heat was scorching, but the men and maids<br/>

  Lightened their toil with merry jest and song;<br/>

  Rested at mid-day, and from brimming bowl,<br/>

  Drank the brown ale, and white abundant milk.<br/>

  The last ear fell, and spiky stubble stood<br/>

  Where waved the forests of dry-murmuring corn;<br/>

  And sheaves rose piled in shocks, like ranged tents<br/>

  Of an encamping army, tent by tent,<br/>

  To stand there while the moon should have her will.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01101">  The grain was ripe. The harvest carts went out<br/>

  Broad-platformed, bearing back the towering load,<br/>

  With frequent passage 'twixt homeyard and field.<br/>

  And half the oats already hid their tops,<br/>

  Their ringing, rustling, wind-responsive sprays,<br/>

  In the still darkness of the towering stack;<br/>

  When in the north low billowy clouds appeared,<br/>

  Blue-based, white-crested, in the afternoon;<br/>

  And westward, darker masses, plashed with blue,<br/>

  And outlined vague in misty steep and dell,<br/>

  Clomb o'er the hill-tops: thunder was at hand.<br/>

  The air was sultry. But the upper sky<br/>

  Was clear and radiant.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01102">                        Downward went the sun,<br/>

  Below the sullen clouds that walled the west,<br/>

  Below the hills, below the shadowed world.<br/>

  The moon looked over the clear eastern wall,<br/>

  And slanting rose, and looked, rose, looked again,<br/>

  And searched for silence in her yellow fields,<br/>

  But found it not. For there the staggering carts,<br/>

  Like overladen beasts, crawled homeward still,<br/>

  Sped fieldward light and low. The laugh broke yet,<br/>

  That lightning of the soul's unclouded skies—<br/>

  Though not so frequent, now that toil forgot<br/>

  Its natural hour. Still on the labour went,<br/>

  Straining to beat the welkin-climbing heave<br/>

  Of the huge rain-clouds, heavy with their floods.<br/>

  Sleep, old enchantress, sided with the clouds,<br/>

  The hoisting clouds, and cast benumbing spells<br/>

  On man and horse. One youth who walked beside<br/>

  A ponderous load of sheaves, higher than wont,<br/>

  Which dared the lurking levin overhead,<br/>

  Woke with a start, falling against the wheel,<br/>

  That circled slow after the slumbering horse.<br/>

  Yet none would yield to soft-suggesting sleep,<br/>

  And quit the last few shocks; for the wild storm<br/>

  Would catch thereby the skirts of Harvest-home,<br/>

  And hold her lingering half-way in the rain.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01103">  The scholar laboured with his men all night.<br/>

  He did not favour such prone headlong race<br/>

  With Nature. To himself he said: "The night<br/>

  Is sent for sleep; we ought to sleep in the night,<br/>

  And leave the clouds to God. Not every storm<br/>

  That climbeth heavenward overwhelms the earth;<br/>

  And when God wills, 'tis better he should will;<br/>

  What he takes from us never can be lost."<br/>

  But the father so had ordered, and the son<br/>

  Went manful to his work, and held his peace.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01104">  When the dawn blotted pale the clouded east,<br/>

  The first drops, overgrown and helpless, fell<br/>

  On the last home-bound cart, oppressed with sheaves;<br/>

  And by its side, the last in the retreat,<br/>

  The scholar walked, slow bringing up the rear.<br/>

  Half the still lengthening journey he had gone,<br/>

  When, on opposing strength of upper winds<br/>

  Tumultuous borne, at last the labouring racks<br/>

  Met in the zenith, and the silence ceased:<br/>

  The lightning brake, and flooded all the world,<br/>

  Its roar of airy billows following it.<br/>

  The darkness drank the lightning, and again<br/>

  Lay more unslaked. But ere the darkness came,<br/>

  In the full revelation of the flash,<br/>

  Met by some stranger flash from cloudy brain,<br/>

  He saw the lady, borne upon her horse,<br/>

  Careless of thunder, as when, years agone,<br/>

  He saw her once, to see for evermore.<br/>

  "Ah, ha!" he said, "my dreams are come for me!<br/>

  Now shall they have me!" For, all through the night,<br/>

  There had been growing trouble in his frame,<br/>

  An overshadowing of something dire.<br/>

  Arrived at home, the weary man and horse<br/>

  Forsook their load; the one went to his stall,<br/>

  The other sought the haven of his bed—<br/>

  There slept and moaned, cried out, and woke, and slept:<br/>

  Through all the netted labyrinth of his brain<br/>

  The fever shot its pent malignant fire.<br/>

  'Twas evening when to passing consciousness<br/>

  He woke and saw his father by his side:<br/>

  His guardian form in every vision drear<br/>

  That followed, watching shone; and the healing face<br/>

  Of his true sister gleamed through all his pain,<br/>

  Soothing and strengthening with cloudy hope;<br/>

  Till, at the weary last of many days,<br/>

  He woke to sweet quiescent consciousness,<br/>

  Enfeebled much, but with a new-born life—<br/>

  His soul a summer evening after rain.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01105">  Slow, with the passing weeks, he gathered strength,<br/>

  And ere the winter came, seemed half restored;<br/>

  And hope was busy. But a fire too keen<br/>

  Burned in his larger eyes; and in his cheek<br/>

  Too ready came the blood at faintest call,<br/>

  Glowing a fair, quick-fading, sunset hue.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01106">  Before its hour, a biting frost set in.<br/>

  It gnawed with icy fangs his shrinking life;<br/>

  And that disease bemoaned throughout the land,<br/>

  The smiling, hoping, wasting, radiant death,<br/>

  Was born of outer cold and inner heat.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01107">  One morn his sister, entering while he slept,<br/>

  Spied in his listless hand a handkerchief<br/>

  Spotted with red. Cold with dismay, she stood,<br/>

  Scared, motionless. But catching in the glass<br/>

  The sudden glimpse of a white ghostly face,<br/>

  She started at herself, and he awoke.<br/>

  He understood, and said with smile unsure,<br/>

  "Bright red was evermore my master-hue;<br/>

  And see, I have it in me: that is why."<br/>

  She shuddered; and he saw, nor jested more,<br/>

  But smiled again, and looked Death in the face.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01108">  When first he saw the red blood outward leap,<br/>

  As if it sought again the fountain-heart<br/>

  Whence it had flowed to fill the golden bowl,<br/>

  No terror seized—an exaltation swelled<br/>

  His spirit: now the pondered mystery<br/>

  Would fling its portals wide, and take him in,<br/>

  One of the awful dead! Them, fools conceive<br/>

  As ghosts that fleet and pine, bereft of weight,<br/>

  And half their valued lives: he otherwise;—<br/>

  Hoped now, and now expected; and, again,<br/>

  Said only, "I await the thing to come."<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01109">  So waits a child the lingering curtain's rise,<br/>

  While yet the panting lamps restrained burn<br/>

  At half-height, and the theatre is full.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01110">  But as the days went by, they brought sad hours,<br/>

  When he would sit, his hands upon his knees,<br/>

  Drooping, and longing for the wine of life.<br/>

  For when the ninefold crystal spheres, through which<br/>

  The outer light sinks in, are cracked and broken,<br/>

  Yet able to keep in the 'piring life,<br/>

  Distressing shadows cross the chequered soul:<br/>

  Poor Psyche trims her irresponsive lamp,<br/>

  And anxious visits oft her store of oil,<br/>

  And still the shadows fall: she must go pray!<br/>

  And God, who speaks to man at door and lattice,<br/>

  Glorious in stars, and winds, and flowers, and waves,<br/>

  Not seldom shuts the door and dims the pane,<br/>

  That, isled in calm, his still small voice may sound<br/>

  The clearer, by the hearth, in the inner room—<br/>

  Sound on until the soul, fulfilled of hope,<br/>

  Look undismayed on that which cannot kill;<br/>

  And saying in the dark, <i>I will the light</i>,<br/>

  Glow in the gloom the present will of God:<br/>

  Then melt the shadows of her shaken house.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01111">  He, when his lamp shot up a spiring flame,<br/>

  Would thus break forth and climb the heaven of prayer:<br/>

  "Do with us what thou wilt, all-glorious heart!<br/>

  Thou God of them that are not yet, but grow!<br/>

  We trust thee for the thing we shall be yet;<br/>

  We too are ill content with what we are."<br/>

  And when the flame sank, and the darkness fell,<br/>

  He lived by faith which is the soul of sight.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01112">  Yet in the frequent pauses of the light,<br/>

  When all was dreary as a drizzling thaw,<br/>

  When sleep came not although he prayed for sleep,<br/>

  And wakeful-weary on his bed he lay,<br/>

  Like frozen lake that has no heaven within;<br/>

  Then, then the sleeping horror woke and stirred,<br/>

  And with the tooth of unsure thought began<br/>

  To gnaw the roots of life:—What if there were<br/>

  No truth in beauty! What if loveliness<br/>

  Were but the invention of a happier mood!<br/>

  "For, if my mind can dim or slay the Fair,<br/>

  Why should it not enhance or make the Fair?"<br/>

  "Nay," Psyche answered; "for a tired man<br/>

  May drop his eyelids on the visible world,<br/>

  To whom no dreams, when fancy flieth free,<br/>

  Will bring the sunny excellence of day.<br/>

  'Tis easy to destroy; God only makes.<br/>

  Could my invention sweep the lucid waves<br/>

  With purple shadows—next create the joy<br/>

  With which my life beholds them? Wherefore should<br/>

  One meet the other without thought of mine,<br/>

  If God did not mean beauty in them and me,<br/>

  But dropped them, helpless shadows, from his sun?<br/>

  There were no God, his image not being mine,<br/>

  And I should seek in vain for any bliss!<br/>

  Oh, lack and doubt and fear can only come<br/>

  Because of plenty, confidence, and love!<br/>

  Those are the shadow-forms about the feet<br/>

  Of these—because they are not crystal-clear<br/>

  To the all-searching sun in which they live:<br/>

  Dread of its loss is Beauty's certain seal!"<br/>

  Thus reasoned mourning Psyche. Suddenly<br/>

  The sun would rise, and vanish Psyche's lamp,<br/>

  Absorbed in light, not swallowed in the dark.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01113">  It was a wintry time with sunny days,<br/>

  With visitings of April airs and scents,<br/>

  That came with sudden presence, unforetold,<br/>

  As brushed from off the outer spheres of spring<br/>

  In the great world where all is old and new.<br/>

  Strange longings he had never known till now,<br/>

  Awoke within him, flowers of rooted hope.<br/>

  For a whole silent hour he would sit and gaze<br/>

  Upon the distant hills, whose dazzling snow<br/>

  Starred the dim blue, or down their dark ravines<br/>

  Crept vaporous; until the fancy rose<br/>

  That on the other side those rampart walls,<br/>

  A mighty woman sat, with waiting face,<br/>

  Calm as that life whose rapt intensity<br/>

  Borders on death, silent, waiting for him,<br/>

  To make him grand for ever with a kiss,<br/>

  And send him silent through the toning worlds.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01114">  The father saw him waning. The proud sire<br/>

  Beheld his pride go drooping in the cold,<br/>

  Like snowdrop on its grave; and sighed deep thanks<br/>

  That he was old. But evermore the son<br/>

  Looked up and smiled as he had heard strange news<br/>

  Across the waste, of tree-buds and primroses.<br/>

  Then all at once the other mood would come,<br/>

  And, like a troubled child, he would seek his father<br/>

  For father-comfort, which fathers all can give:<br/>

  Sure there is one great Father in the world,<br/>

  Since every word of good from fathers' lips<br/>

  Falleth with such authority, although<br/>

  They are but men as we! This trembling son,<br/>

  Who saw the unknown death draw hourly nigher,<br/>

  Sought solace in his father's tenderness,<br/>

  And made him strong to die.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01115">                            One shining day,<br/>

  Shining with sun and snow, he came and said,<br/>

  "What think you, father—is death very sore?"<br/>

  "My boy," the father answered, "we will try<br/>

  To make it easy with the present God.<br/>

  But, as I judge, though more by hope than sight,<br/>

  It seems much harder to the lookers on<br/>

  Than to the man who dies. Each panting breath<br/>

  We call a gasp, may be in him the cry<br/>

  Of infant eagerness; or, at worst, the sob<br/>

  With which the unclothed spirit, step by step.<br/>

  Wades forth into the cool eternal sea.<br/>

  I think, my boy, death has two sides to it—<br/>

  One sunny, and one dark—as this round earth<br/>

  Is every day half sunny and half dark.<br/>

  We on the dark side call the mystery <i>death</i>;<br/>

  They on the other, looking down in light,<br/>

  Wait the glad <i>birth</i>, with other tears than ours."<br/>

  "Be near me, father, when I die," he said.<br/>

  "I will, my boy, until a better Father<br/>

  Draws your hand out of mine. Be near in turn,<br/>

  When my time comes—you in the light beyond,<br/>

  And knowing well the country—I in the dark."<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01116">  The days went by, until the tender green<br/>

  Shone through the snow in patches. Then the hope<br/>

  Of life, reviving faintly, stirred his heart;<br/>

  For the spring drew him—warm, soft, budding spring,<br/>

  With promises, and he went forth to meet her.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01117">  But he who once had strode a king on the fields,<br/>

  Walked softly now; lay on the daisied grass;<br/>

  And sighed sometimes in secret, that so soon<br/>

  The earth, with all its suns and harvests fair,<br/>

  Must lie far off, an old forsaken thing.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01118">  But though I lingering listen to the old,<br/>

  Ere yet I strike new chords that seize the old<br/>

  And lift their lost souls up the music-stair—<br/>

  Think not he was too fearful-faint of heart<br/>

  To look the blank unknown full in the void;<br/>

  For he had hope in God—the growth of years,<br/>

  Of ponderings, of childish aspirations,<br/>

  Of prayers and readings and repentances;<br/>

  For something in him had ever sought the peace<br/>

  Of other something deeper in him still—<br/>

  A <i>faint</i> sound sighing for a harmony<br/>

  With other fainter sounds, that softly drew<br/>

  Nearer and nearer from the unknown depths<br/>

  Where the Individual goeth out in God:<br/>

  The something in him heard, and, hearing, listened,<br/>

  And sought the way by which the music came,<br/>

  Hoping at last to find the face of him<br/>

  To whom Saint John said <i>Lord</i> with holy awe,<br/>

  And on his bosom fearless leaned the while.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01119">  As his slow spring came on, the swelling life,<br/>

  The new creation inside of the old,<br/>

  Pressed up in buds toward the invisible.<br/>

  And burst the crumbling mould wherein it lay.<br/>

  Not once he thought of that still churchyard now;<br/>

  He looked away from earth, and loved the sky.<br/>

  One earthly notion only clung to him:—<br/>

  He thanked God that he died not in the cold;<br/>

  "For," said he, "I would rather go abroad<br/>

  When the sun shines, and birds are singing blithe.—It<br/>

  may be that we know not aught of place,<br/>

  Or any sense, and only live in thought;<br/>

  But, knowing not, I cling to warmth and light.<br/>

  I <i>may</i> pass forth into the sea of air<br/>

  That swings its massy waves around the earth,<br/>

  And I would rather go when it is full<br/>

  Of light, and blue, and larks, than when gray fog<br/>

  Dulls it with steams of old earth winter-sick.<br/>

  Now in the dawn of summer I shall die—<br/>

  Sinking asleep ere sunset, I will hope,<br/>

  And going with the light. And when they say,<br/>

  'He's dead; he rests at last; his face is changed;'<br/>

  I shall be saying:  Yet, yet, I live, I love!'"<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01120">  The weary nights did much to humble him;<br/>

  They made the good he knew seem all ill known:<br/>

  He would go by and by to school again!<br/>

  "Father," he said, "I am nothing; but Thou <i>art</i>!"<br/>

  Like half-asleep, whole-dreaming child, he was,<br/>

  Who, longing for his mother, has forgot<br/>

  The arms about him, holding him to her heart:<br/>

  <i>Mother</i> he murmuring moans; she wakes him up<br/>

  That he may see her face, and sleep indeed.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01121">  Father! we need thy winter as thy spring;<br/>

  We need thy earthquakes as thy summer showers;<br/>

  But through them all thy strong arms carry us,<br/>

  Thy strong heart bearing large share in our grief.<br/>

  Because thou lovest goodness more than joy<br/>

  In them thou lovest, thou dost let them grieve:<br/>

  We must not vex thee with our peevish cries,<br/>

  But look into thy face, and hold thee fast,<br/>

  And say <i>O Father, Father</i>! when the pain<br/>

  Seems overstrong. Remember our poor hearts:<br/>

  We never grasp the zenith of the time!<br/>

  We have no spring except in winter-prayers!<br/>

  But we believe—alas, we only hope!—That<br/>

  one day we shall thank thee perfectly<br/>

  For every disappointment, pang, and shame,<br/>

  That drove us to the bosom of thy love.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01122">  One night, as oft, he lay and could not sleep.<br/>

  His spirit was a chamber, empty, dark,<br/>

  Through which bright pictures passed of the outer world:<br/>

  The regnant Will gazed passive on the show;<br/>

  The magic tube through which the shadows came,<br/>

  Witch Memory turned and stayed. In ones and troops,<br/>

  Glided across the field the things that were,<br/>

  Silent and sorrowful, like all things old:<br/>

  Even old rose-leaves have a mournful scent,<br/>

  And old brown letters are more sad than graves.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01123">  At length, as ever in such vision-hours,<br/>

  Came the bright maiden, high upon her horse.<br/>

  Will started all awake, passive no more,<br/>

  And, necromantic sage, the apparition<br/>

  That came unbid, commanded to abide.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01124">  Gathered around her form his brooding thoughts:<br/>

  How had she fared, spinning her history<br/>

  Into a psyche-cradle? With what wings<br/>

  Would she come forth to greet the aeonian summer?<br/>

  Glistening with feathery dust of silver? or<br/>

  Dull red, and seared with spots of black ingrained?<br/>

  "I know," he said, "some women fail of life!<br/>

  The rose hath shed her leaves: is she a rose?"<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01125">  The fount of possibilities began<br/>

  To gurgle, threatful, underneath the thought:<br/>

  Anon the geyser-column raging rose;—<br/>

  For purest souls sometimes have direst fears<br/>

  In ghost-hours when the shadow of the earth<br/>

  Is cast on half her children, and the sun<br/>

  Is busy giving daylight to the rest.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01126">  "Oh, God!" he cried, "if she be such as those!—<br/>

  Angels in the eyes of poet-boys, who still<br/>

  Fancy the wavings of invisible wings,<br/>

  But, in their own familiar, chamber-thoughts,<br/>

  Common as clay, and of the trodden earth!—<br/>

  It cannot, cannot be! She is of God!—<br/>

  And yet things lovely perish! higher life<br/>

  Gives deeper death! fair gifts make fouler faults!—<br/>

  Women themselves—I dare not think the rest!"<br/>

  Such thoughts went walking up and down his soul<br/>

  But found at last a spot wherein to rest,<br/>

  Building a resolution for the day.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01127">  The next day, and the next, he was too worn<br/>

  To clothe intent in body of a deed.<br/>

  A cold dry wind blew from the unkindly east,<br/>

  Making him feel as he had come to the earth<br/>

  Before God's spirit moved on the water's face,<br/>

  To make it ready for him.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01128">                            But the third<br/>

  Morning rose radiant. A genial wind<br/>

  Rippled the blue air 'neath the golden sun,<br/>

  And brought glad summer-tidings from the south.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01129">  He lay now in his father's room; for there<br/>

  The southern sun poured all the warmth he had.<br/>

  His rays fell on the fire, alive with flames,<br/>

  And turned it ghostly pale, and would have slain—<br/>

  Even as the sunshine of the higher life,<br/>

  Quenching the glow of this, leaves but a coal.<br/>

  He rose and sat him down 'twixt sun and fire;<br/>

  Two lives fought in him for the mastery;<br/>

  And half from each forth flowed the written stream<br/>

  "Lady, I owe thee much. Stay not to look<br/>

  Upon my name: I write it, but I date<br/>

  From the churchyard, where it shall lie in peace,<br/>

  Thou reading it. Thou know'st me not at all;<br/>

  Nor dared I write, but death is crowning me<br/>

  Thy equal. If my boldness yet offend,<br/>

  Lo, pure in my intent, I am with the ghosts;<br/>

  Where when thou comest, thou hast already known<br/>

  God equal makes at first, and Death at last."<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01130">  "But pardon, lady. Ere I had begun,<br/>

  My thoughts moved toward thee with a gentle flow<br/>

  That bore a depth of waters: when I took<br/>

  My pen to write, they rushed into a gulf,<br/>

  Precipitate and foamy. Can it be<br/>

  That Death who humbles all hath made me proud?"<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01131">  "Lady, thy loveliness hath walked my brain,<br/>

  As if I were thy heritage bequeathed<br/>

  From many sires; yet only from afar<br/>

  I have worshipped thee—content to know the vision<br/>

  Had lifted me above myself who saw,<br/>

  And ta'en my angel nigh thee in thy heaven.<br/>

  Thy beauty, lady, hath overflowed, and made<br/>

  Another being beautiful, beside,<br/>

  With virtue to aspire and be itself.<br/>

  Afar as angels or the sainted dead,<br/>

  Yet near as loveliness can haunt a man,<br/>

  Thy form hath put on each revealing dress<br/>

  Of circumstance and history, high or low,<br/>

  In which, from any tale of selfless life,<br/>

  Essential womanhood hath shone on me."<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01132">  "Ten years have passed away since the first time,<br/>

  Which was the last, I saw thee. What have these<br/>

  Made or unmade in thee?—I ask myself.<br/>

  O lovely in my memory! art thou<br/>

  As lovely in thyself? Thy glory then<br/>

  Was what God made thee: art thou such indeed?<br/>

  Forgive my boldness, lady—I am dead:<br/>

  The dead may cry, their voices are so small."<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01133">  "I have a prayer to make thee—hear the dead.<br/>

  Lady, for God's sake be as beautiful<br/>

  As that white form that dwelleth in my heart;<br/>

  Yea, better still, as that ideal Pure<br/>

  That waketh in thee, when thou prayest God,<br/>

  Or helpest thy poor neighbour. For myself<br/>

  I pray. For if I die and find that she,<br/>

  My woman-glory, lives in common air,<br/>

  Is not so very radiant after all,<br/>

  My sad face will afflict the calm-eyed ghosts,<br/>

  Unused to see such rooted sorrow there.<br/>

  With palm to palm my kneeling ghost implores<br/>

  Thee, living lady—justify my faith<br/>

  In womanhood's white-handed nobleness,<br/>

  And thee, its revelation unto me."<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01134">  "But I bethink me:—If thou turn thy thoughts<br/>

  Upon thyself, even for that great sake<br/>

  Of purity and conscious whiteness' self,<br/>

  Thou wilt but half succeed. The other half<br/>

  Is to forget the former, yea, thyself,<br/>

  Quenching thy moonlight in the blaze of day,<br/>

  Turning thy being full unto thy God.<br/>

  Be thou in him a pure, twice holy child,<br/>

  Doing the right with sweet unconsciousness—<br/>

  Having God in thee, thy completing soul."<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01135">  "Lady, I die; the Father holds me up.<br/>

  It is not much to thee that I should die;<br/>

  It may be much to know he holds me up."<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01136">  "I thank thee, lady, for the gentle look<br/>

  Which crowned me from thine eyes ten years ago,<br/>

  Ere, clothed in nimbus of the setting sun,<br/>

  Thee from my dazzled eyes thy horse did bear,<br/>

  Proud of his burden. My dull tongue was mute—<br/>

  I was a fool before thee; but my silence<br/>

  Was the sole homage possible to me then:<br/>

  That now I speak, and fear not, is thy gift.<br/>

  The same sweet look be possible to thee<br/>

  For evermore! I bless thee with thine own,<br/>

  And say farewell, and go into my grave—<br/>

  No, to the sapphire heaven of all my hopes."<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01137">  Followed his name in full, and then the name<br/>

  Of the green churchyard where his form should lie.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01138">  Back to his couch he crept, weary, and said:<br/>

  "O God, I am but an attempt at life!<br/>

  Sleep falls again ere I am full awake.<br/>

  Light goeth from me in the morning hour.<br/>

  I have seen nothing clearly; felt no thrill<br/>

  Of pure emotion, save in dreams, ah—dreams!<br/>

  The high Truth has but flickered in my soul—<br/>

  Even at such times, in wide blue midnight hours,<br/>

  When, dawning sudden on my inner world,<br/>

  New stars came forth, revealing unknown depths,<br/>

  New heights of silence, quelling all my sea,<br/>

  And for a moment I saw formless fact,<br/>

  And knew myself a living lonely thought,<br/>

  Isled in the hyaline of Truth alway!<br/>

  I have not reaped earth's harvest, O my God;<br/>

  Have gathered but a few poor wayside flowers,<br/>

  Harebells, red poppies, daisies, eyebrights blue—<br/>

  Gathered them by the way, for comforting!<br/>

  Have I aimed proudly, therefore aimed too low,<br/>

  Striving for something visible in my thought,<br/>

  And not the unseen thing hid far in thine?<br/>

  Make me content to be a primrose-flower<br/>

  Among thy nations, so the fair truth, hid<br/>

  In the sweet primrose, come awake in me,<br/>

  And I rejoice, an individual soul,<br/>

  Reflecting thee—as truly then divine<br/>

  As if I towered the angel of the sun.<br/>

  Once, in a southern eve, a glowing worm<br/>

  Gave me a keener joy than the heaven of stars:<br/>

  Thou camest in the worm nearer me then!<br/>

  Nor do I think, were I that green delight,<br/>

  I would change to be the shadowy evening star.<br/>

  Ah, make me, Father, anything thou wilt,<br/>

  So be thou will it! I am safe with thee.<br/>

  I laugh exulting. Make me something, God—<br/>

  Clear, sunny, veritable purity<br/>

  Of mere existence, in thyself content.<br/>

  And seeking no compare. Sure I <i>have</i> reaped<br/>

  Earth's harvest if I find this holy death!—<br/>

  Now I am ready; take me when thou wilt."<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01139">  He laid the letter in his desk, with seal<br/>

  And superscription. When his sister came,<br/>

  He told her where to find it—afterwards.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01140">  As the slow eve, through paler, darker shades,<br/>

  Insensibly declines, until at last<br/>

  The lordly day is but a memory,<br/>

  So died he. In the hush of noon he died.<br/>

  The sun shone on—why should he not shine on?<br/>

  Glad summer noises rose from all the land;<br/>

  The love of God lay warm on hill and plain:<br/>

  'Tis well to die in summer.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01141">                              When the breath,<br/>

  After a hopeless pause, returned no more,<br/>

  The father fell upon his knees, and said:<br/>

  "O God, I thank thee; it is over now!<br/>

  Through the sore time thy hand has led him well.<br/>

  Lord, let me follow soon, and be at rest."<br/>

  Therewith he rose, and comforted the maid,<br/>

  Who in her brother had lost the pride of life,<br/>

  And wept as all her heaven were only rain.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01142">  Of the loved lady, little more I know.<br/>

  I know not if, when she had read his words,<br/>

  She rose in haste, and to her chamber went,<br/>

  And shut the door; nor if, when she came forth,<br/>

  A dawn of holier purpose gleamed across<br/>

  The sadness of her brow. But this I know,<br/>

  That, on a warm autumnal afternoon,<br/>

  When headstone-shadows crossed three neighbour graves,<br/>

  And, like an ended prayer, the empty church<br/>

  Stood in the sunshine, or a cenotaph,<br/>

  A little boy, who watched a cow near by<br/>

  Gather her milk where alms of clover-fields<br/>

  Lay scattered on the sides of silent roads,<br/>

  All sudden saw, nor knew whence she had come,<br/>

  A lady, veiled, alone, and very still,<br/>

  Seated upon a grave. Long time she sat<br/>

  And moved not, weeping sore, the watcher said—<br/>

  Though how he knew she wept, were hard to tell.<br/>

  At length, slow-leaning on her elbow down,<br/>

  She hid her face a while in the short grass,<br/>

  And pulled a something small from off the mound—<br/>

  A blade of grass it must have been, he thought,<br/>

  For nothing else was there, not even a daisy—<br/>

  And put it in a letter. Then she rose,<br/>

  And glided silent forth, over the wall,<br/>

  Where the two steps on this side and on that<br/>

  Shorten the path from westward to the church.—<br/>

  The clang of hoofs and sound of light, swift wheels<br/>

  Arose and died upon the listener's ear.<br/>

<h4 id="id02434" style="margin-top: 2em">  I.</h4>

<p id="id02435">  I lay and dreamed. The Master came,<br/>

    In seamless garment drest;<br/>

  I stood in bonds 'twixt love and shame,<br/>

    Not ready to be blest.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id02436">  He stretched his arms, and gently sought<br/>

    To clasp me to his heart;<br/>

  I shrank, for I, unthinking, thought<br/>

    He knew me but in part.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id02437">  I did not love him as I would!<br/>

    Embraces were not meet!<br/>

  I dared not ev'n stand where he stood—<br/>

    I fell and kissed his feet.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id02438">  Years, years have passed away since then;<br/>

    Oft hast thou come to me;<br/>

  The question scarce will rise again<br/>

<p id="id02440">  But when fresh light and visions bold<br/>

    My heart and hope expand,<br/>

  Up comes the vanity of old<br/>

    That now I understand:<br/>
</p>

<p id="id02441">  Away, away from thee I drift,<br/>

    Forgetting, not forgot;<br/>

    Red rocks and sounding caves!<br/>

<p id="id02560">  Dreaming, I wept. Awake, I ask—<br/>

    Shall earthly dreams, forsooth,<br/>

  Set the old Heavens too hard a task<br/>

    To match them with the truth?<br/>

<p id="id02562">  Once more I build a dream, awake,<br/>

    Which sleeping I would dream;<br/>

  Once more an unborn fancy take<br/>

    And try to make it seem!<br/>

  Some strange delight shall fill my breast,<br/>

    Enticed from sleep's abyss,<br/>

  With sense of motion, yet of rest,<br/>

    Of sleep, yet waking bliss!<br/>
</p>

<p id="id02563">  It comes!—I lie on something warm<br/>

    That lifts me from below;<br/>

  It rounds me like a mighty arm<br/>

    Though soft as drifted snow.<br/>

  A dream, indeed!—Oh, happy me<br/>

    Whom Titan woman bears<br/>

  Afloat upon a gentle sea<br/>

    Of wandering midnight airs!<br/>
</p>

<p id="id02564">  A breeze, just cool enough to lave<br/>

    With sense each conscious limb,<br/>

  Glides round and under, like a wave<br/>

    Of twilight growing dim!<br/>

  She bears me over sleeping towns,<br/>

    O'er murmuring ears of corn;<br/>

  O'er tops of trees, o'er billowy downs,<br/>

    O'er moorland wastes forlorn.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id02565">  The harebells in the mountain-pass<br/>

    Flutter their blue about;<br/>

  The myriad blades of meadow grass<br/>

    Float scarce-heard music out.<br/>

  Over the lake!—ah! nearer float,<br/>

    Nearer the water's breast;<br/>

  Let me look deeper—let me doat<br/>

    Upon that lily-nest.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id02566">  Old homes we brush—in wood, on road;<br/>

    Their windows do not shine;<br/>

  Their dwellers must be all abroad<br/>

    In lovely dreams like mine!<br/>

  Hark—drifting syllables that break<br/>

    Like foam-bells on fleet ships!<br/>

  The little airs are all awake<br/>

    With softly kissing lips.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id02567">  Light laughter ripples down the wind,<br/>

    Sweet sighs float everywhere;<br/>

  But when I look I nothing find,<br/>

    For every star is there.<br/>

  O lady lovely, lady strong,<br/>

    Ungiven thy best gift lies!<br/>

  Thou bear'st me in thine arms along,<br/>

    Dost not reveal thine eyes!<br/>
</p>

<p id="id02568">  Pale doubt lifts up a snaky crest,<br/>

    In darts a pang of loss:<br/>

  My outstretched hand, for hills of rest,<br/>

    Finds only mounds of moss!<br/>

  Faint and far off the stars appear;<br/>

    The wind begins to weep;<br/>

  'Tis night indeed, chilly and drear,<br/>

    And all but me asleep!<br/>

  A rock where ancient waters' rise and dip,<br/>

  Had worn and worn, while races lived and died,<br/>

  Involved channels. Where the sea-weed's drip<br/>

  Followed the ebb, now crumbling lichens sip<br/>

My gift would find thee fast asleep,
  And arise a dream in thee;
A violet sky o'er the roll and sweep
  Of a purple and pallid sea;
And a crescent moon from my sky should creep
  In the golden dream to thee.

Thou shouldst lay thee down, and sadly list
  To the wail of our cold birth-time;
And build thee a temple, glory-kissed,
  In the heart of the sunny clime;
Its columns should rise in a music-mist,
  And its roofs in a spirit-rhyme.

Its pillars the solemn hills should bind
  'Neath arches of starry deeps;
Its floor the earth all veined and lined;
  Its organ the ocean-sweeps;
And, swung in the hands of the grey-robed wind,
  Its censers the blossom-heaps.

And 'tis almost done; for in this my rhyme,
  Thanks to thy mirror-soul,
Thou wilt see the mountains, and hear the chime
  Of the waters after the roll;
And the stars of my sky thy sky will climb,
  And with heaven roof in the whole.

<p id="id01724">  I walked all night: the darkness did not yield.<br/>

  Around me fell a mist, a weary rain,<br/>

  Enduring long. At length the dawn revealed<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01725">  A temple's front, high-lifted from the plain.<br/>

  Closed were the lofty doors that led within;<br/>

  But by a wicket one might entrance gain.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01726">  'Twas awe and silence when I entered in;<br/>

  The night, the weariness, the rain were lost<br/>

  In hopeful spaces. First I heard a thin<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01727">  Sweet sound of voices low, together tossed,<br/>

  As if they sought some harmony to find<br/>

  Which they knew once, but none of all that host<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01728">  Could wile the far-fled music back to mind.<br/>

  Loud voices, distance-low, wandered along<br/>

  The pillared paths, and up the arches twined<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01729">  With sister arches, rising, throng on throng,<br/>

  Up to the roof's dim height. At broken times<br/>

  The voices gathered to a burst of song,<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01730">  But parted sudden, and were but single rimes<br/>

  By single bells through Sabbath morning sent,<br/>

  That have no thought of harmony or chimes.<br/>

<p id="id01731">  Hopeful confusion! Who could be content<br/>

  Looking and hearkening from the distant door?<br/>

  I entered further. Solemnly it went—<br/>

<p id="id01732">  Thy voice, Truth's herald, walking the untuned roar,<br/>

  Calm and distinct, powerful and sweet and fine:<br/>

  Upon the face of the void formless deep!<br/>

  Worship thee all day long, and through the skies<br/>

  Follow thy journey with their earnest eyes.<br/>

  River of life, thou pourest on the woods,<br/>

  And on thy waves float out the wakening buds;<br/>

  The trees lean toward thee, and, in loving pain,<br/>

  Keep turning still to see thee yet again;<br/>

  South sides of pines, haunted all day by thee,<br/>

  Bear violins that tremble humanly.<br/>

  Climbing the heights of all their towering steeps.<br/>

  Sudden, still multitudinous laughter crowds<br/>

  The universal face: Lo, silently,<br/>

  Capricious, like the thinkings of the child!<br/>

  I am a child again, to think of thee<br/>

  In thy consummate glee.<br/>

  How I would play with thee, athirst to climb<br/>

  On sloping ladders of thy moted beams,<br/>

  When through the gray dust darting in long streams!<br/>

  How marvel at the dusky glimmering red,<br/>

  With which my closed fingers thou hadst made<br/>

  Like rainy clouds that curtain the sun's bed!<br/>

  And how I loved thee always in the moon!<br/>

  But most about the harvest-time,<br/>

  When corn and moonlight made a mellow tune,<br/>

  And thou wast grave and tender as a cooing dove!<br/>

  And then the stars that flashed cold, deathless love!<br/>

  And the ghost-stars that shimmered in the tide!<br/>

  And more mysterious earthly stars,<br/>

  That shone from windows of the hill and glen—<br/>

  Thee prisoned in with lattice-bars,<br/>

  Mingling with household love and rest of weary men!<br/>

  And still I am a child, thank God!—to spy<br/>

  Thee starry stream from bit of broken glass<br/>

  Upon the brown earth undescried,<br/>

  Is a found thing to me, a gladness high,<br/>

  A spark that lights joy's altar-fire within,<br/>

  To gather song from radiance, in his chair<br/>

  Sits by the door; and sitteth there<br/>

  His soul within him, like a child that lies<br/>

  Through rifted loop to light upon the gold<br/>

  That waves its bloom in some high airy rent:<br/>

  Even like a lord of music bent<br/>

  Over his instrument,<br/>

  Giving to carol, now to tempest birth!<br/>

  When, clear as holiness, the morning ray<br/>

  Casts the rock's dewy darkness at its feet,<br/>

  Mottling with shadows all the mountain gray;<br/>

  When, at the hour of sovereign noon,<br/>

  Infinite silent cataracts sheet<br/>

  Shadowless through the air of thunder-breeding June;<br/>

  When now a yellower glory slanting passes<br/>

  'Twixt longer shadows o'er the meadow grasses;<br/>

  And now the moon lifts up her shining shield,<br/>

  High on the peak of a cloud-hill revealed;<br/>

  Now crescent, low, wandering sun-dazed away,<br/>

  Unconscious of her own star-mingled ray,<br/>

  Her still face seeming more to think than see,<br/>

  Makes the pale world lie dreaming dreams of thee!<br/>

  No mood, eternal or ephemeral,<br/>

  But wakes obedient at thy silent call!<br/>

  Lo thee in yellow sands! Lo thee<br/>

  In the blue air and sea!<br/>

  In the green corn, with scarlet poppies lit,<br/>

  Thy half-souls parted, patient thou dost sit.<br/>

  Lo thee in dying triumphs of the west!<br/>

  Lo thee in dew-drop's tiny breast!<br/>

  Thee on the vast white cloud that floats away,<br/>

  Thy hoardless wealth of gleam and glow!<br/>

  The thousand hues and shades upon the flowers<br/>

  Why art thou awful to our eyes, and sweet?<br/>

  Cherished as love, and slaying with a touch?<br/>

  Why in thee do the known and unknown meet?<br/>

  Why swift and tender, strong and delicate?<br/>

  Simple as truth, yet manifold in might?<br/>

  Why does one love thee, and another hate?<br/>

  Why cleave my words to the portals of my speech<br/>

  When I a goodly matter would indite?<br/>

  Why mounts my thought of thee beyond my reach?<br/>

  —In vain to follow thee, I thee beseech,<br/>

  For God is light.<br/>

THE OUTER DREAM.

Young, as the day's first-born Titanic brood,
Lifting their foreheads jubilant to heaven,
Rose the great mountains on my opening dream.
And yet the aged peace of countless years
Reposed on every crag and precipice
Outfacing ruggedly the storms that swept
Far overhead the sheltered furrow-vales;
Which smiled abroad in green as the clouds broke
Drifting adown the tide of the wind-waves,
Till shattered on the mountain rocks. Oh! still,
And cold and hard to look upon, like men
Who do stern deeds in times of turbulence,
Quell the hail-rattle with their granite brows,
And let the thunder burst and pass away--
They too did gather round sky-dwelling peaks
The trailing garments of the travelling sun,
Which he had lifted from his ocean-bed,
And swept along his road. They rent them down
In scattering showers upon the trees and grass,
In noontide rains with heavy ringing drops,
Or in still twilight moisture tenderly.
And from their sides were born the gladsome streams;
Some creeping gently out in tiny springs,
As they were just created, scarce a foot
From the hill's surface, in the matted roots
Of plants, whose green betrays the secret birth;
Some hurrying forth from caverns deep and dark,
Upfilling to the brim a basin huge,
Thick covered with soft moss, greening the wave,
As evermore it welled over the edge
Upon the rocks below in boiling heaps;
Fit basin for a demi-god at morn,
Waking amid the crags, to lave his limbs,
Then stride, Hyperion, o'er sun-paven peaks.
And down the hill-side sped the fresh-born wave,
Now hid from sight in arched caverns cold,
Now arrowing slantwise down the terraced steep,
Now springing like a child from step to step
Of the rough water-stair; until it found
A deep-hewn passage for its slower course,
Guiding it down to lowliness and rest,
Betwixt wet walls of darkness, darker yet
With pine trees lining all their sides like hair,
Or as their own straight needles clothe their boughs;
Until at length in broader light it ran,
With more articulate sounds amid the stones,
In the slight shadow of the maiden birch,
And the stream-loving willow; and ere long
Great blossoming trees dropt flowers upon its breast;
Chiefly the crimson-spotted, cream-white flowers,
Heaped up in cones amid cone-drooping leaves;
Green hanging leaf-cones, towering white flower-cones
Upon the great cone-fashioned chestnut tree.
Each made a tiny ripple where it fell,
The trembling pleasure of the smiling wave,
Which bore it then, in slow funereal course,
Down to the outspread sunny sheen, where lies
The lake uplooking to the far-off snow,
Its mother still, though now so far away;
Feeding it still with long descending lines
Of shining, speeding streams, that gather peace
In journeying to the rest of that still lake
Now lying sleepy in the warm red sun,
Which says its dear goodnight, and goeth down.

All pale, and withered, and disconsolate,
The moon is looking on impatiently;
For 'twixt the shining tent-roof of the day,
And the sun-deluged lake, for mirror-floor,
Her thin pale lamping is too sadly grey
To shoot, in silver-barbed, white-plumed arrows,
Cold maiden splendours on the flashing fish:
Wait for thy empire Night, day-weary moon!
And thou shalt lord it in one realm at least,
Where two souls walk a single Paradise.
Take to thee courage, for the sun is gone;
His praisers, the glad birds, have hid their heads;
Long, ghost-like forms of trees lie on the grass;
All things are clothed in an obscuring light,
Fusing their outline in a dreamy mass;
Some faint, dim shadows from thy beauty fall
On the clear lake which melts them half away--
Shine faster, stronger, O reviving moon!
Burn up, O lamp of Earth, hung high in Heaven!

And through a warm thin summer mist she shines,
A silver setting to the diamond stars;
And the dark boat cleaveth a glittering way,
Where the one steady beauty of the moon
Makes many changing beauties on the wave
Broken by jewel-dropping oars, which drive
The boat, as human impulses the soul;
While, like the sovereign will, the helm's firm law
Directs the whither of the onward force.
At length midway he leaves the swaying oars
Half floating in the blue gulf underneath,
And on a load of gathered flowers reclines,
Leaving the boat to any air that blows,
His soul to any pulse from the unseen heart.
Straight from the helm a white hand gleaming flits,
And settles on his face, and nestles there,
Pale, night-belated butterfly, to sleep.
For on her knees his head lies satisfied;
And upward, downward, dark eyes look and rest,
Finding their home in likeness.   Lifting then
Her hair upon her white arm heavily,
The overflowing of her beauteousness,
Her hand that cannot trespass, singles out
Some of the curls that stray across her lap;
And mingling dark locks in the pallid light,
She asks him which is darker of the twain,
Which his, which hers, and laugheth like a lute.
But now her hair, an unvexed cataract,
Falls dark and heavy round his upturned face,
And with a heaven shuts out the shallow sky,
A heaven profound, the home of two black stars;
Till, tired with gazing, face to face they lie,
Suspended, with closed eyelids, in the night;
Their bodies bathed in conscious sleepiness,
While o'er their souls creeps every rippling breath
Of the night-gambols of the moth-winged wind,
Flitting a handbreadth, folding up its wings,
Its dreamy wings, then spreading them anew,
And with an unfelt gliding, like the years,
Wafting them to a water-lily bed,
Whose shield-like leaves and chalice-bearing arms
Hold back the boat from the slow-sloping shore,
Far as a child might shoot with his toy-bow.
There the long drooping grass drooped to the wave;
And, ever as the moth-wind lit thereon,
A small-leafed tree, whose roots were always cool,
Dipped one low bow, with many sister-leaves,
Upon the water's face with a low plash,
Lifting and dipping yet and yet again;
And aye the water-drops rained from the leaves,
With music-laughter as they found their home.
And from the woods came blossom-fragrance, faint,
Or full, like rising, falling harmonies;
Luxuriance of life, which overflows
In scents ethereal on the ocean air;
Each breathing on the rest the blessedness
Of its peculiar being, filled with good
Till its cup runneth over with delight:
They drank the mingled odours as they lay,
The air in which the sensuous being breathes,
Till summer-sleep fell on their hearts and eyes.

The night was mild and innocent of ill;
'Twas but a sleeping day that breathed low,
And babbled in its sleep. The moon at length
Grew sleepy too. Her level glances crept
Through sleeping branches to their curtained eyes,
As down the steep bank of the west she slid,
Slowly and slowly

                 But alas! alas!
The awful time 'twixt moondown and sunrise!
It is a ghostly time. A low thick fog
Steamed up and swathed the trees, and overwhelmed
The floating couch with pall on pall of grey.
The sky was desolate, dull, and meaningless.
The blazing hues of the last sunset eve,
And the pale magic moonshine that had made
The common, strange,--all were swept clean away;
The earth around, the great sky over, were
Like a deserted theatre, tomb-dumb;
The lights long dead; the first sick grey of morn
Oozing through rents in the slow-mouldering curtain;
The sweet sounds fled away for evermore;
Nought left, except a creeping chill, a sense
As if dead deeds were strown upon the stage,
As if dead bodies simulated life,
And spoke dead words without informing thought.
A horror, as of power without a soul,
Dark, undefined, and mighty unto ill,
Jarred through the earth and through the vault-like air.

And on the sleepers fell a wondrous dream,
That dured till sunrise, filling all the cells
Remotest of the throbbing heart and brain.
And as I watched them, ever and anon
The quivering limb and half-unclosèd eye
Witnessed of torture scarce endured, and yet
Endured; for still the dream had mastery,
And held them in a helplessness supine;
Till, by degrees, the labouring breath grew calm,
Save frequent murmured sighs; and o'er each face
Stole radiant sadness, and a hopeful grief;
And the convulsive motion passed away.

Upon their faces, reading them, I gazed,--
Reading them earnestly, like wondrous book,--
When suddenly the vapours of the dream
Rose and enveloped me, and through my soul
Passed with possession; will fell fast asleep.
And through the portals of the spirit-land,
Upon whose frontiers time and space grow dumb,
Quenched like a cloud that all the roaring wind
Drives not beyond the mountain top, I went,
And entering, beheld them in their dream.
Their world inwrapt me for the time as mine,
And what befel them there, I saw, and tell.


THE INNER DREAM.

It was a drizzly morning where I stood.
The cloud had sunk, and filled with fold on fold
The chimneyed city; so the smoke rose not,
But spread diluted in the cloud, and fell
A black precipitate on miry streets,
Where dim grey faces vision-like went by,
But half-awake, half satisfied with sleep.

Slave engines had begun their ceaseless growl
Of labour. Iron bands and huge stone blocks
That held them to their task, strained, shook, until
The city trembled. Those pale-visaged forms
Were hastening on to feed their groaning strength
With labour to the full.

                        Look! there they come,
Poor amid poverty; she with her gown
Drawn over her meek head; he trying much,
But fruitless half, to shield her from the rain.
They enter the wide gates, amid the jar,
And clash, and shudder of the awful force
That, conquering force, still vibrates on, as if
With an excess of power, hungry for work.
With differing strength to different tasks they part,
To be the soul of knowledge unto strength;
For man has eked his body out with wheels,
And cranks, and belts, and levers, pinions, screws--
One body all, pervaded still with life
From man the maker's will. 'Mid keen-eyed men,
Thin featured and exact, his part is found;
Hers where the dusk air shines with lustrous eyes.

And there they laboured through the murky day,
Whose air was livid mist, their only breath;
Foul floating dust of swift revolving wheels
And feathery spoil of fast contorted threads
Making a sultry chaos in the sun.
Until at length slow swelled the welcome dark,
A dull Lethean heaving tide of death,
Up from the caves of Night to make an end;
And filling every corner of the place,
Choked in its waves the clanking of the looms.
And Earth put on her sleeping dress, and took
Her children home into its bosom-folds,
And nursed them as a mother-ghost might sit
With her neglected darlings in the dark.
So with dim satisfaction in their hearts,
Though with tired feet and aching head, they went,
Parting the clinging fog to find their home.
It was a dreary place. Unfinished walls,
Far drearier than ruins overspread
With long-worn sweet forgetfulness, amidst
Earth-heaps and bricks, rain-pools and ugliness,
Rose up around, banishing further yet
The Earth, with its spring-time, young-mother smile,
From children's eyes that had forgot to play.
But though the house was dull and wrapt in fog,
It yet awoke to life, yea, cheerfulness,
When darkness oped a fire-eye in the grate,
And the dim candle's smoky flame revealed
A room which could not be all desolate,
Being a temple, proven by the signs
Seen in the ancient place. For here was light;
And blazing fire with darkness on its skirts;
Bread; and pure water, ready to make clean,
Beside a chest of holiday attire;
And in the twilight edges of the light,
A book scarce seen; and for the wondrous veil,
Those human forms, behind which lay concealed
The Holy of Holies, God's own secret place,
The lowly human heart wherein He dwells.
And by the table-altar they sat down
To eat their Eucharist, God feeding them:
Their food was Love, made visible in Form--
Incarnate Love in food. For he to whom
A common meal can be no Eucharist,
Who thanks for food and strength, not for the love
That made cold water for its blessedness,
And wine for gladness' sake, has yet to learn
The heart-delight of inmost thankfulness
For innermost reception.

                        Then they sat
Resting with silence, the soul's inward sleep,
Which feedeth it with strength; till gradually
They grew aware of light, that overcame
The light within, and through the dingy blind,
Cast from the window-frame, two shadow-glooms
That made a cross of darkness on the white,
Dark messenger of light itself unseen.
The woman rose, and half she put aside
The veil that hid the whole of glorious night;
And lo! a wind had mowed the earth-sprung fog;
And lo! on high the white exultant moon
From clear blue window curtained all with white,
Greeted them, at their shadowy window low,
With quiet smile; for two things made her glad:
One that she saw the glory of the sun;
For while the earth lay all athirst for light,
She drank the fountain-waves. The other joy;
Sprung from herself: she fought the darkness well,
Thinning the great cone-shadow of the earth,
Paling its ebon hue with radiant showers
Upon its sloping side. The woman said,
With hopeful look: "To-morrow will be bright
With sunshine for our holiday--to-morrow--
Think! we shall see the green fields in the sun."
So with hearts hoping for a simple joy,
Yet high withal, being no less than the sun,
They laid them down in nightly death that waits
Patiently for the day.

                      That sun was high
When they awoke at length. The moon, low down,
Had almost vanished, clothed upon with light;
And night was swallowed up of day. In haste,
Chiding their weariness that leagued with sleep,
They, having clothed themselves in clean attire,
By the low door, stooping with priestly hearts,
Entered God's vision-room, his wonder-world.

One side the street, the windows all were moons
To light the other that in shadow lay.
The path was almost dry; the wind asleep.
And down the sunny side a woman came
In a red cloak that made the whole street glad--
Fit clothing, though she was so feeble and old;
For when they stopped and asked her how she fared,
She said with cheerful words, and smile that owed
None of its sweetness to an ivory lining:
"I'm always better in the open air."
"Dear heart!" said they, "how freely she will breathe
In the open air of heaven!" She stood in the morn
Like a belated autumn-flower in spring,
Dazed by the rushing of the new-born life
Up the earth's winding cavern-stairs to see
Through window-buds the calling, waking sun.
Or as in dreams we meet the ghost of one
Beloved in youth, who walketh with few words,
And they are of the past. Yet, joy to her!
She too from earthy grave was climbing up
Unto the spirit-windows high and far,
She the new life for a celestial spring,
Answering the light that shineth evermore.

With hopeful sadness thus they passed along
Dissolving streets towards the smiles of spring,
Of which green visions gleamed and glided by,
Across far-narrowing avenues of brick:
The ripples only of her laughter float
Through the low winding caverns of the town;
Yet not a stone upon the paven street,
But shareth in the impulse of her joy,
Heaven's life that thrills anew through the outworn earth;
Descending like the angel that did stir
Bethesda's pool, and made the sleepy wave
Pulse with quick healing through the withered limb,
In joyous pangs. By an unfinished street,
Forth came they on a wide and level space;
Green fields lay side by side, and hedgerow trees
Stood here and there as waiting for some good.
But no calm river meditated through
The weary flat to the less level sea;
No forest trees on pillared stems and boughs
Bent in great Gothic arches, bore aloft
A cloudy temple-roof of tremulous leaves;
No clear line where the kissing lips of sky
And earth meet undulating, but a haze
That hides--oh, if it hid wild waves! alas!
It hides but fields, it hides but fields and trees!
Save eastward, where a few hills, far away,
Came forth in the sun, or drew back when the clouds
Went over them, dissolving them in shade.
But the life-robe of earth was beautiful,
As all most common things are loveliest;
A forest of green waving fairy trees,
That carpeted the earth for lowly feet,
Bending unto their tread, lowliest of all
Earth's lowly children born for ministering
Unto the heavenly stranger, stately man;
That he, by subtle service from all kinds,
From every breeze and every bounding wave,
From night-sky cavernous with heaps of storm,
And from the hill rejoicing in the sun,
Might grow a humble, lowly child of God;
Lowly, as knowing his high parentage;
Humble, because all beauties wait on him,
Like lady-servants ministering for love.
And he that hath not rock, and hill, and stream,
Must learn to look for other beauty near;
To know the face of ocean solitudes,
The darkness dashed with glory, and the shades
Wind-fretted, and the mingled tints upthrown
From shallow bed, or raining from the sky.
And he that hath not ocean, and dwells low,
Not hill-befriended, if his eyes have ceased
To drink enjoyment from the billowy grass,
And from the road-side flower (like one who dwells
With homely features round him every day,
And so takes refuge in the loving eyes
Which are their heaven, the dwelling-place of light),
Must straightway lift his eyes unto the heavens,
Like God's great palette, where His artist hand
Never can strike the brush, but beauty wakes;
Vast sweepy comet-curves, that net the soul
In pleasure; endless sky-stairs; patient clouds,
White till they blush at the sun's goodnight kiss;
And filmy pallours, and great mountain crags.
But beyond all, absorbing all the rest,
Lies the great heaven, the expression of deep space,
Foreshortened to a vaulted dome of blue;
The Infinite, crowded in a single glance,
Where yet the eye descends depth within depth;
Like mystery of Truth, clothed in high form,
Evasive, spiritual, no limiting,
But something that denies an end, and yet
Can be beheld by wondering human eyes.
There looking up, one well may feel how vain
To search for God in this vast wilderness!
For over him would arch void depth for ever;
Nor ever would he find a God or Heaven,
Though lifting wings were his to soar abroad
Through boundless heights of space; or eyes to dive
To microscopic depths: he would come back,
And say, _There is no God;_ and sit and weep;
Till in his heart a child's voice woke and cried,
_Father! my Father!_ Then the face of God
Breaks forth with eyes, everywhere, suddenly
And not a space of blue, nor floating cloud,
Nor grassy vale, nor distant purple height,
But, trembling with a presence all divine,
Says, _Here I am, my child._

                            Gazing awhile,
They let the lesson of the sky sink deep
Into their hearts; withdrawing then their eyes,
They knew the Earth again. And as they went,
Oft in the changing heavens, those distant hills
Shone clear upon the horizon. Then awoke
A strange and unknown longing in their souls,
As if for something loved in years gone by,
And vanished in its beauty and its love
So long, that it retained no name or form,
And lay on childhood's verge, all but forgot,
Wrapt in the enchanted rose-mists of that land:
As if amidst those hills were wooded dells,
Summer, and gentle winds, and odours free,
Deep sleeping waters, gorgeous flowers, and birds,
Pure winged throats. But here, all things around
Were in their spring. The very light that lay
Upon the grass seemed new-born like the grass,
Sprung with it from the earth. The very stones
Looked warm. The brown ploughed earth seemed swelling up,
Filled like a sponge with sunbeams, which lay still,
Nestling unseen, and broodingly, and warm,
In every little nest, corner, or crack,
Wherein might hide a blind and sleepy seed,
Waiting the touch of penetrative life
To wake, and grow, and beautify the earth.
The mossy stems and boughs, where yet no life
Exuberant overflowed in buds and leaves,
Were clothed in golden splendours, interwoven
With many shadows from the branches bare.
And through their tops the west wind rushing went,
Calling aloud the sleeping sap within:
The thrill passed downwards from the roots in air
To the roots tremulous in the embracing ground.
And though no buds with little dots of light
Sparkled the darkness of the hedgerow twigs;
Softening, expanding in the warm light-bath,
Seemed the dry smoky bark.

                          Thus in the fields
They spent their holiday. And when the sun
Was near the going down, they turned them home
With strengthened hearts. For they were filled with light,
And with the spring; and, like the bees, went back
To their dark house, laden with blessed sights,
With gladsome sounds home to their treasure-cave;
Where henceforth sudden gleams of spring would pass
Thorough the four-walled darkness of the room;
And sounds of spring-time whisper trembling by,
Though stony streets with iron echoed round.
And as they crossed a field, they came by chance
Upon a place where once a home had been;
Fragments of ruined walls, half-overgrown
With moss, for even stones had their green robe.
It had been a small cottage, with a plot
Of garden-ground in front, mapped out with walks
Now scarce discernible, but that the grass
Was thinner, the ground harder to the foot:
The place was simply shadowed with an old
Almost erased human carefulness.
Close by the ruined wall, where once had been
The door dividing it from the great world,
Making it _home_, a single snowdrop grew.
'Twas the sole remnant of a family
Of flowers that in this garden once had dwelt,
Vanished with all their hues of glowing life,
Save one too white for death.

                             And as its form
Arose within the brain, a feeling sprung
Up in their souls, new, white, and delicate;
A waiting, longing, patient hopefulness,
The snowdrop of the heart. The heavenly child,
Pale with the earthly cold, hung its meek head,
Enduring all, and so victorious;
The Summer's earnest in the waking Earth,
The spirit's in the heart.

                          I love thee, flower,
With a love almost human, tenderly;
The Spring's first child, yea, thine, my hoping heart!
Upon thy inner leaves and in thy heart,
Enough of green to tell thou know'st the grass;
In thy white mind remembering lowly friends;
But most I love thee for that little stain
Of earth on thy transfigured radiancy,
Which thou hast lifted with thee from thy grave,
The soiling of thy garments on thy road,
Travelling forth into the light and air,
The heaven of thy pure rest. Some gentle rain
Will surely wash thee white, and send the earth
Back to the place of earth; but now it signs
Thee child of earth, of human birth as we.

With careful hands uprooting it, they bore
The little plant a willing captive home;
Willing to enter dark abodes, secure
In its own tale of light. As once of old,
Bearing all heaven in words of promising,
The Angel of the Annunciation came,
It carried all the spring into that house;
A pot of mould its only tie to Earth,
Its heaven an ell of blue 'twixt chimney-tops,
Its world henceforth that little, low-ceiled room,
Symbol and child of spring, it took its place
'Midst all those types, to be a type with them,
Of what so many feel, not knowing it;
The hidden springtime that is drawing nigh.
And henceforth, when the shadow of the cross
Will enter, clothed in moonlight, still and dark,
The flower will nestle at its foot till day,
Pale, drooping, heart-content.

                              To rest they went.
And all night long the snowdrop glimmered white
Amid the dark, unconscious and unseen.

Before the sun had crowned his eastern hill
With its world-diadem, they woke.

                                 I looked
Out of the windows of the inner dream,
And saw the edge of the sun's glory rise
Eastward behind the hills, the lake-cup's rim.
And as it came, it sucked up in itself,
As deeds drink words, or daylight candle-flame,
That other sun rising to light the dream.
They lay awake and thoughtful, comforted
With yesterday which nested in their hearts,
Yet haunted with the sound of grinding wheels.


THE OUTER DREAM.

And as they lay and looked into the room,
It wavered, changed, dissolved beneath the sun,
Which mingled both the mornings in their eyes,
Till the true conquered, and the unreal passed.
No walls, but woods bathed in a level sun;
No ceiling, but the vestal sky of morn;
No bed, but flowers floating 'mid floating leaves
On water which grew audible as they stirred
And lifted up their heads. And a low wind
That flowed from out the west, washed from their eye
The last films of the dream. And they sat up,
Silent for one long cool delicious breath,
Gazing upon each other lost and found,
With a dumb ecstasy, new, undefined.
Followed a long embrace, and then the oars
Broke up their prison-bands.

                            And through the woods
They slowly went, beneath a firmament
Of boughs, and clouded leaves, filmy and pale
In the sunshine, but shadowy on the grass.
And roving odours met them on their way,
Sun-quickened odours, which the fog had slain.
And their green sky had many a blossom-moon,
And constellations thick with starry flowers.
And deep and still were all the woods, except
For the Memnonian, glory-stricken birds;
And golden beetles 'mid the shadowy roots,
Green goblins of the grass, and mining mice;
And on the leaves the fairy butterflies,
Or doubting in the air, scarlet and blue.
The divine depth of summer clasped the Earth.

But 'twixt their hearts and summer's perfectness
Came a dividing thought that seemed to say:
"_Ye wear strange looks._" Did summer speak, or they?
They said within: "We know that ye are fair,
Bright flowers; but ye shine far away, as in
A land of other thoughts. Alas! alas!

"Where shall we find the snowdrop-bell half-blown?
What shall we do? we feel the throbbing spring
Bursting in new and unexpressive thoughts;
Our hearts are swelling like a tied-up bud,
And summer crushes them with too much light.
Action is bubbling up within our souls;
The woods oppress us more than stony streets;
That was the life indeed; this is the dream;
Summer is too complete for growing hearts;
They need a broken season, and a land
With shadows pointing ever far away;
Where incompleteness rouses longing thoughts
With spires abrupt, and broken spheres, and circles
Cut that they may be widened evermore:
Through shattered cloudy roof, looks in the sky,
A discord from a loftier harmony;
And tempests waken peace within our thoughts,
Driving them inward to the inmost rest.
Come, my beloved, we will haste and go
To those pale faces of our fellow men;
Our loving hearts, burning with summer-fire,
Will cast a glow upon their pallidness;
Our hands will help them, far as servants may;
Hands are apostles still to saviour-hearts.
So we may share their blessedness with them;
So may the snowdrop time be likewise ours;
And Earth smile tearfully the spirit smile
Wherewith she smiled upon our holiday,
As a sweet child may laugh with weeping eyes.
If ever we return, these glorious flowers
May all be snowdrops of a higher spring."
Their eyes one moment met, and then they knew
That they did mean the same thing in their hearts.
So with no farther words they turned and went
Back to the boat, and so across the mere.

I wake from out my dream, and know my room,
My darling books, the cherub forms above;
I know 'tis springtime in the world without;
I feel it springtime in my world within;
I know that bending o'er an early flower,
Crocus, or primrose, or anemone,
The heart that striveth for a higher life,
And hath not yet been conquered, findeth there
A beauty deep, unshared by any rose,
A human loveliness about the flower;
That a heath-bell upon a lonely waste
Hath more than scarlet splendour on thick leaves;
That a blue opening 'midst rain-bosomed clouds
Is more than Paphian sun-set harmonies;
That higher beauty dwells on earth, because
Man seeks a higher home than Paradise;
And, having lost, is roused thereby to fill
A deeper need than could be filled by all
The lost ten times restored; and so he loves
The snowdrop more than the magnolia;
Spring-hope is more to him than summer-joy;
Dark towns than Eden-groves with rivers four.

<p id="id01145">  Let your tears flow; let your sad sighs have scope;<br/>

  Only take heed they fan, they water Hope.<br/>
</p>

<h2 id="id01146" style="margin-top: 4em">A STORY OF THE SEA-SHORE.</h2>

<h5 id="id01147">INTRODUCTION.</h5>

<p id="id01148">  I sought the long clear twilights of my home,<br/>

  Far in the pale-blue skies and slaty seas,<br/>

  What time the sunset dies not utterly,<br/>

  But withered to a ghost-like stealthy gleam,<br/>

  Round the horizon creeps the short-lived night,<br/>

  And changes into sunrise in a swoon.<br/>

  I found my home in homeliness unchanged:<br/>

  The love that made it home, unchangeable,<br/>

  Received me as a child, and all was well.<br/>

  My ancient summer-heaven, borne on the hills,<br/>

  Once more embraced me; and once more the vale,<br/>

  So often sighed for in the far-off nights,<br/>

  Rose on my bodily vision, and, behold,<br/>

  In nothing had the fancy mocked the fact!<br/>

  The hasting streams went garrulous as of old;<br/>

  The resting flowers in silence uttered more;<br/>

  The blue hills rose and dwelt alone in heaven;<br/>

  Householding Nature from her treasures brought<br/>

  Things old and new, the same yet not the same,<br/>

  For all was holier, lovelier than before;<br/>

  And best of all, once more I paced the fields<br/>

  With him whose love had made me long for God<br/>

  So good a father that, needs-must, I sought<br/>

  A better still, Father of him and me.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01149">  Once on a day, my cousin Frank and I<br/>

  Sat swiftly borne behind the dear white mare<br/>

  That oft had carried me in bygone days<br/>

  Along the lonely paths of moorland hills;<br/>

  But now we sought the coast, where deep waves foam<br/>

  'Gainst rocks that lift their dark fronts to the north.<br/>

  And with us went a girl, on whose kind face<br/>

  I had not looked for many a youthful year,<br/>

  But the old friendship straightway blossomed new.<br/>

  The heavens were sunny, and the earth was green;<br/>

  The large harebells in families stood along<br/>

  The grassy borders, of a tender blue<br/>

  Transparent as the sky, haunted with wings<br/>

  Of many butterflies, as blue as they.<br/>

  And as we talked and talked without restraint,<br/>

  Brought near by memories of days that were,<br/>

  And therefore are for ever; by the joy<br/>

  Of motion through a warm and shining air;<br/>

  By the glad sense of freedom and like thoughts;<br/>

  And by the bond of friendship with the dead,<br/>

  She told the tale which here I tell again.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01150">  I had returned to childish olden time,<br/>

  And asked her if she knew a castle worn,<br/>

  Whose masonry, razed utterly above,<br/>

  Yet faced the sea-cliff up, and met the waves:—<br/>

  'Twas one of my child-marvels; for, each year,<br/>

  We turned our backs upon the ripening corn,<br/>

  And sought some village on the Moray shore;<br/>

  And nigh this ruin, was that I loved the best.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01151">  For oh the riches of that little port!—<br/>

  Down almost to the beach, where a high wall<br/>

  Inclosed them, came the gardens of a lord,<br/>

  Free to the visitor with foot restrained—<br/>

  His shady walks, his ancient trees of state;<br/>

  His river—that would not be shut within,<br/>

  But came abroad, went dreaming o'er the sands,<br/>

  And lost itself in finding out the sea;<br/>

  Inside, it bore grave swans, white splendours—crept<br/>

  Under the fairy leap of a wire bridge,<br/>

  Vanished in leaves, and came again where lawns<br/>

  Lay verdurous, and the peacock's plumy heaven<br/>

  Bore azure suns with green and golden rays.<br/>

  It was my childish Eden; for the skies<br/>

  Were loftier in that garden, and the clouds<br/>

  More summer-gracious, edged with broader white;<br/>

  And when they rained, it was a golden rain<br/>

  That sparkled as it fell—an odorous rain.<br/>

  And then its wonder-heart!—a little room,<br/>

  Half-hollowed in the side of a steep hill,<br/>

  Which rose, with columned, windy temple crowned,<br/>

  A landmark to far seas. The enchanted cell<br/>

  Was clouded over in the gentle night<br/>

  Of a luxuriant foliage, and its door,<br/>

  Half-filled with rainbow hues of coloured glass,<br/>

  Opened into the bosom of the hill.<br/>

  Never to sesame of mine that door<br/>

  Gave up its sanctuary; but through the glass,<br/>

  Gazing with reverent curiosity,<br/>

  I saw a little chamber, round and high,<br/>

  Which but to see was to escape the heat,<br/>

  And bathe in coolness of the eye and brain;<br/>

  For all was dusky greenness; on one side,<br/>

  A window, half-blind with ivy manifold,<br/>

  Whose leaves, like heads of gazers, climbed to the top,<br/>

  Gave a joy-saddened light, for all that came<br/>

  Through the thick veil was green, oh, kindest hue!<br/>

  But the heart has a heart—this heart had one:<br/>

  Still in the midst, the <i>ever more</i> of all,<br/>

  On a low column stood, white, cold, dim-clear,<br/>

  A marble woman. Who she was I know not—<br/>

  A Psyche, or a Silence, or an Echo:<br/>

  Pale, undefined, a silvery shadow, still,<br/>

  In one lone chamber of my memory,<br/>

  She is a power upon me as of old.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01152">  But, ah, to dream there through hot summer days,<br/>

  In coolness shrouded and sea-murmurings,<br/>

  Forgot by all till twilight shades grew dark!<br/>

  To find half-hidden in the hollowed wall,<br/>

  A nest of tales, old volumes such as dreams<br/>

  Hoard up in bookshops dim in tortuous streets!<br/>

  That wondrous marble woman evermore<br/>

  Filling the gloom with calm delirium<br/>

  Of radiated whiteness, as I read!—<br/>

  The fancied joy, too plenteous for its cup,<br/>

  O'erflowed, and turned to sadness as it fell.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01153">  But the gray ruin on the shattered shore,<br/>

  Not the green refuge in the bowering hill,<br/>

  Drew forth our talk that day. For, as I said,<br/>

  I asked her if she knew it. She replied,<br/>

  "I know it well. A woman used to live<br/>

  In one of its low vaults, my mother says."<br/>

  "I found a hole," I said, "and spiral stair,<br/>

  Leading from level of the ground above<br/>

  To a low-vaulted room within the rock,<br/>

  Whence through a small square window I looked forth<br/>

  Wide o'er the waters; the dim-sounding waves<br/>

  Were many feet below, and shrunk in size<br/>

  To a great ripple." "'Twas not there," she said,<br/>

  "—Not in that room half up the cliff, but one<br/>

  Low down, within the margin of spring tides:<br/>

  When both the tide and northern wind are high,<br/>

  'Tis more an ocean-cave than castle-vault."<br/>

  And then she told me all she knew of her.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01154">  It was a simple tale, a monotone:<br/>

  She climbed one sunny hill, gazed once abroad,<br/>

  Then wandered down, to pace a dreary plain;<br/>

  Alas! how many such are told by night,<br/>

  In fisher-cottages along the shore!<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01155">  Farewell, old summer-day! I turn aside<br/>

  To tell her story, interwoven with thoughts<br/>

  Born of its sorrow; for I dare not think<br/>

  A woman at the mercy of a sea.<br/>
</p>

<h3 id="id01156" style="margin-top: 3em">                   THE STORY.</h3>

<p id="id01157">  Aye as it listeth blows the listless wind,<br/>

  Swelling great sails, and bending lordly masts,<br/>

  Or hurrying shadow-waves o'er fields of corn,<br/>

  And hunting lazy clouds across the sky:<br/>

  Now, like a white cloud o'er another sky,<br/>

  It blows a tall brig from the harbour's mouth,<br/>

  Away to high-tossed heads of wallowing waves,<br/>

  'Mid hoverings of long-pinioned arrowy birds.<br/>

  With clouds and birds and sails and broken crests,<br/>

  All space is full of spots of fluttering white,<br/>

  And yet the sailor knows that handkerchief<br/>

  Waved wet with tears, and heavy in the wind.<br/>

  Blow, wind! draw out the cord that binds the twain;<br/>

  Draw, for thou canst not break the lengthening cord.<br/>

  Blow, wind! yet gently; gently blow, fair wind!<br/>

  And let love's vision slowly, gently die;<br/>

  Let the bright sails all solemn-slowly pass,<br/>

  And linger ghost-like o'er the vanished hull,<br/>

  With a white farewell to her straining eyes;<br/>

  For never more in morning's level beams,<br/>

  Will those sea-shadowing sails, dark-stained and worn,<br/>

  From the gray-billowed north come dancing in;<br/>

  Oh, never, gliding home 'neath starry skies,<br/>

  Over the dusk of the dim-glancing sea,<br/>

  Will the great ship send forth a herald cry<br/>

  Of home-come sailors, into sleeping streets!<br/>

  Blow gently, wind! blow slowly, gentle wind!<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01158">  Weep not yet, maiden; 'tis not yet thy hour.<br/>

  Why shouldst thou weep before thy time is come?<br/>

  Go to thy work; break into song sometimes—<br/>

  Song dying slow-forgotten, in the lapse<br/>

  Of dreamy thought, ere natural pause ensue,<br/>

  Or sudden dropt what time the eager heart<br/>

  Hurries the ready eye to north and east.<br/>

  Sing, maiden, while thou canst, ere yet the truth,<br/>

  Slow darkening, choke the heart-caged singing bird!<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01159">  The weeks went by. Oft leaving household work,<br/>

  With bare arms and uncovered head she clomb<br/>

  The landward slope of the prophetic hill;<br/>

  From whose green head, as from the verge of time,<br/>

  Far out on the eternity of blue,<br/>

  Shading her hope-rapt eyes, seer-like she gazed,<br/>

  If from the Hades of the nether world,<br/>

  Slow climbing up the round side of the earth,<br/>

  Haply her prayers were drawing his tardy sails<br/>

  Over the threshold of the far sky-sea—<br/>

  Drawing her sailor home to celebrate,<br/>

  With holy rites of family and church,<br/>

  The apotheosis of maidenhood.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01160">  Months passed; he came not; and a shadowy fear,<br/>

  Long haunting the horizon of her soul,<br/>

  In deeper gloom and sharper form drew nigh;<br/>

  And growing in bulk, possessed her atmosphere,<br/>

  And lost all shape, because it filled all space,<br/>

  And reached beyond the bounds of consciousness—<br/>

  In sudden incarnations darting swift<br/>

  From out its infinite a gulfy stare<br/>

  Of terror blank, of hideous emptiness,<br/>

  Of widowhood ere ever wedding-day.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01161">  On granite ridge, and chalky cliff, and pier,<br/>

  Far built into the waves along our shores,<br/>

  Maidens have stood since ever ships went forth;<br/>

  The same pain at the heart; the same slow mist<br/>

  Clouding the eye; the same fixed longing look,<br/>

  As if the soul had gone, and left the door<br/>

  Wide open—gone to lean, hearken, and peer<br/>

  Over the awful edge where voidness sinks<br/>

  Sheer to oblivion—that horizon-line<br/>

  Over whose edge he vanished—came no more.<br/>

  O God, why are our souls, waste, helpless seas,<br/>

  Tortured with such immitigable storm?<br/>

  What is this love, that now on angel wing<br/>

  Sweeps us amid the stars in passionate calm;<br/>

  And now with demon arms fast cincturing,<br/>

  Drops us, through all gyrations of keen pain,<br/>

  Down the black vortex, till the giddy whirl<br/>

  Gives fainting respite to the ghastly brain?<br/>

  O happy they for whom the Possible<br/>

  Opens its gates of madness, and becomes<br/>

  The Real around them!—such to whom henceforth<br/>

  There is but one to-morrow, the next morn,<br/>

  Their wedding-day, ever one step removed,<br/>

  The husband's foot ever upon the verge<br/>

  Of the day's threshold, in a lasting dream!<br/>

  Such madness may be but a formless faith—<br/>

  A chaos which the breath of God will blow<br/>

  Into an ordered world of seed and fruit.<br/>

  Shall not the Possible become the Real?<br/>

  God sleeps not when he makes his daughters dream.<br/>

  Shall not the morrow dawn at last which leads<br/>

  The maiden-ghost, confused and half awake,<br/>

  Into the land whose shadows are our dreams?—<br/>

  Thus questioning we stand upon the shore,<br/>

  And gaze across into the Unrevealed.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01162">  Upon its visible symbol gazed the girl,<br/>

  Till earth behind her ceased, and sea was all,<br/>

  Possessing eyes and brain and shrinking soul—<br/>

  A universal mouth to swallow up,<br/>

  And close eternally in one blue smile!<br/>

  A still monotony of pauseless greed,<br/>

  Its only voice an endless, dreary song<br/>

  Of wailing, and of craving from the world!<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01163">  A low dull dirge that ever rose and died,<br/>

  Recurring without pause or change or close,<br/>

  Like one verse chaunted ever in sleepless brain,<br/>

  Still drew her to the shore. It drew her down,<br/>

  Like witch's spell, that fearful endless moan;<br/>

  Somewhere, she thought, in the green abyss below,<br/>

  His body, at the centre of the moan,<br/>

  Obeyed the motions whence the moaning grew;<br/>

  Now, now, in circle slow revolved, and now<br/>

  Swayed like a wind-swung bell, now swept along<br/>

  Hither and thither, idly to and fro,<br/>

  Heedlessly wandering through the heedless sea.<br/>

  Its fascination drew her onward still—<br/>

  On to the ridgy rocks that seaward ran,<br/>

  And out along their furrows and jagged backs,<br/>

  To the last lonely point where the green mass<br/>

  Arose and sank, heaved slow and forceful. There<br/>

  She shuddered and recoiled. Thus, for a time,<br/>

  Sport-slave of power occult, she came and went,<br/>

  Betwixt the shore and sea alternating,<br/>

  Drawn ever to the greedy lapping lip,<br/>

  Then, terror-stung, driven backward: there it lay,<br/>

  The heartless, cruel, miserable deep,<br/>

  Ambushed in horror, with its glittering eye<br/>

  Still drawing her to its green gulfing maw!<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01164">  But every ocean hath its isles, each woe<br/>

  Its scattered comfortings; and this was one<br/>

  That often came to her—that she, wave-caught,<br/>

  Must, in the wash of ever-shifting waters,<br/>

  In some good hour sure-fixed of pitiful fate,<br/>

  <i>All-conscious still of love, despite the sea</i>,<br/>

  Float over some stray bone, some particle,<br/>

  Which far-diffused sense would know as his:<br/>

  Heart-glad she would sit down, and watch the tide<br/>

  Slow-growing—till it reached at length her feet,<br/>

  When, at its first cold touch, up she would spring,<br/>

  And, ghastful, flee, with white-rimmed sightless eye.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01165">  But still, where'er she fled, the sea-voice followed;<br/>

  Whisperings innumerable of water-drops<br/>

  Would grow together to a giant cry;<br/>

  Now hoarse, half-stifled, pleading, warning tones,<br/>

  Now thunderous peals of billowy, wrathful shouts,<br/>

  Called after her to come, and make no pause.<br/>

  From the loose clouds that mingled with the spray,<br/>

  And from the tossings of the lifted seas,<br/>

  Where plunged and rose the raving wilderness,<br/>

  Outreaching arms, pursuing, beckoning hands,<br/>

  Came shoreward, lengthening, feeling after her.<br/>

  Then would she fling her own wild arms on high,<br/>

  Over her head, in tossings like the waves,<br/>

  Or fix them, with clasped hands of prayer intense,<br/>

  Forward, appealing to the bitter sea.<br/>

  Sometimes she sudden from her shoulders tore<br/>

  Her garments, one by one, and cast them out<br/>

  Into the roarings of the heedless surge,<br/>

  In vain oblation to the hungry waves.<br/>

  As vain was Pity's will to cover her;<br/>

  Best gifts but bribed the sea, and left her bare.<br/>

  In her poor heart and brain burned such a fire<br/>

  That all-unheeded cold winds lapped her round,<br/>

  And sleet-like spray flashed on her tawny skin.<br/>

  Her food she seldom ate; her naked arms<br/>

  Flung it far out to feed the sea; her hair<br/>

  Streamed after it, like rooted ocean-weed<br/>

  In headlong current. But, alas, the sea<br/>

  Took it, and came again—it would have <i>her</i>!<br/>

  And as the wave importunate, so despair,<br/>

  Back surging, on her heart rushed ever afresh:<br/>

  Sickening she moaned—half muttered and half moaned—<br/>

  "She winna be content; she'll hae mysel!"<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01166">  But when the night grew thick upon the sea,<br/>

  Quenching it almost, save its quenchless voice,<br/>

  Then, half-released until the light, she rose,<br/>

  And step by step withdrew—as dreaming man,<br/>

  With an eternity of slowness, drags<br/>

  His earth-bound, lead-like, irresponsive feet<br/>

  Back from a sleeping horror, she withdrew.<br/>

  But when, upon the narrow beach at last,<br/>

  She turned her back upon her hidden foe,<br/>

  It blended with her phantom-breeding brain,<br/>

  And, scared at very fear, she cried and fled—<br/>

  Fled to the battered base of the old tower,<br/>

  And round the rock, and through the arched gap<br/>

  Into the yawning blackness of the vault—<br/>

  There sank upon the sand, and gasped, and raved.<br/>

  Close cowering in a nook, she sat all night,<br/>

  Her face turned to the entrance of the vault,<br/>

  Through which a pale light shimmered—from the eye<br/>

  Of the great sleepless ocean—Argus more dread<br/>

  Than he with hundred lidless watching orbs,<br/>

  And slept, and dreamed, and dreaming saw the sea.<br/>

  But in the stormy nights, when all was dark,<br/>

  And the wild tempest swept with slanting wing<br/>

  Against her refuge, and the heavy spray<br/>

  Shot through the doorway serpentine cold arms<br/>

  To seize the fore-doomed morsel of the sea,<br/>

  She slept not, evermore stung to new life<br/>

  By new sea-terrors. Now it was the gull:<br/>

  His clanging pinions darted through the arch,<br/>

  And flapped about her head; now 'twas a wave<br/>

  Grown arrogant: it rushed into her house,<br/>

  Clasped her waist-high, then out again and away<br/>

  To swell the devilish laughter in the fog,<br/>

  And leave her clinging to the rocky wall,<br/>

  With white face watching. When it came no more,<br/>

  And the tide ebbed, not yet she slept—sat down,<br/>

  And sat unmoving, till the low gray dawn<br/>

  Grew on the misty dance of spouting waves,<br/>

  That made a picture in the rugged arch;<br/>

  Then the old fascination woke and drew;<br/>

  And, rising slowly, forth she went afresh,<br/>

  To haunt the border of the dawning sea.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01167">  Yet all the time there lay within her soul<br/>

  An inner chamber, quietest place; but she<br/>

  Turned from its door, and staid out in the storm.<br/>

  She, entering there, had found a refuge calm<br/>

  As summer evening, as a mother's arms.<br/>

  There had she found her lost love, only lost<br/>

  In that he slept, and she was still awake.<br/>

  There she had found, waiting for her to come,<br/>

  The Love that waits and watches evermore.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01168">  Thou too hast such a chamber, quietest place,<br/>

  Where that Love waits for thee. What is it, say,<br/>

  That will not let thee enter? Is it care<br/>

  For the provision of the unborn day,<br/>

  As if thou wert a God that must foresee?<br/>

  Is it poor hunger for the praise of men?<br/>

  Is it ambition to outstrip thy fellow<br/>

  In this world's race? Or is it love of self—<br/>

  That greed which still to have must still destroy?—<br/>

  Go mad for some lost love; some voice of old,<br/>

  Which first thou madest sing, and after sob;<br/>

  Some heart thou foundest rich, and leftest bare,<br/>

  Choking its well of faith with thy false deeds—<br/>

  Unlike thy God, who keeps the better wine<br/>

  Until the last, and, if he giveth grief,<br/>

  Giveth it first, and ends the tale with joy:<br/>

  Such madness clings about the feet of God,<br/>

  Nor lets them go. Better a thousandfold<br/>

  Be she than thou! for though thy brain be strong<br/>

  And clear and workful, hers a withered flower<br/>

  That never came to seed, her heart is full<br/>

  Of that in whose live might God made the world;<br/>

  She is a well, and thou an empty cup.<br/>

  It was the invisible unbroken cord<br/>

  Between the twain, her and her sailor-lad,<br/>

  That drew her ever to the ocean marge.<br/>

  Better to die for love, to rave for love,<br/>

  Than not to love at all! but to have loved,<br/>

  And, loved again, then to have turned away—<br/>

  Better than that, never to have been born!<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01169">  But if thy heart be noble, say if thou<br/>

  Canst ever all forget an hour of pain,<br/>

  When, maddened with the thought that could not be,<br/>

  Thou might'st have yielded to the demon wind<br/>

  That swept in tempest through thy scorching brain,<br/>

  And rushed into the night, and howled aloud,<br/>

  And clamoured to the waves, and beat the rocks;<br/>

  And never found thy way back to the seat<br/>

  Of conscious self, and power to rule thy pain,<br/>

  Had not God made thee strong to bear and live!<br/>

  The tale is now in thee, not thou in it;<br/>

  But the sad woman, in her wildest mood,<br/>

  Thou knowest her thy sister! She is fair<br/>

  No more; her eyes like fierce suns blaze and burn;<br/>

  Her cheeks are parched and brown; her haggard form<br/>

  Is wasted by wild storms of soul and sea;<br/>

  Yet in her very self is that which still<br/>

  Reminds thee of a story, old, not dead,<br/>

  Which God has in his keeping—of thyself.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01170">  Ah, not forgot are children when they sleep!<br/>

  The darkness lasts all night, and clears the eyes;<br/>

  Then comes the morning with the joy of light.<br/>

  Oh, surely madness hideth not from Him!<br/>

  Nor doth a soul cease to be beautiful<br/>

  In his sight, that its beauty is withdrawn,<br/>

  And hid by pale eclipse from human eyes.<br/>

  As the chill snow is friendly to the earth,<br/>

  And pain and loss are friendly to the soul,<br/>

  Shielding it from the black heart-killing frost;<br/>

  So madness is but one of God's pale winters;<br/>

  And when the winter over is and gone,<br/>

  Then smile the skies, then blooms the earth again,<br/>

  And the fair time of singing birds is come:<br/>

  Into the cold wind and the howling night,<br/>

  God sent for her, and she was carried in<br/>

  Where there was no more sea.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01171">                              What messenger<br/>

  Ran from the door of heaven to bring her home?<br/>

  The sea, her terror.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01172">                      In the rocks that stand<br/>

  Below the cliff, there lies a rounded hollow,<br/>

  Scooped like a basin, with jagged and pinnacled sides:<br/>

  Low buried when the wind heaps up the surge,<br/>

  It lifts in the respiration of the tide<br/>

  Its broken edges, and, then, deep within<br/>

  Lies resting water, radiantly clear:<br/>

  There, on a morn of sunshine, while the wind<br/>

  Yet blew, and heaved yet the billowy sea<br/>

  With memories of a night of stormy dreams,<br/>

  At rest they found her: in the sleep which is<br/>

  And is not death, she, lying very still,<br/>

  Absorbed the bliss that follows after pain.<br/>

  O life of love, conquered at last by fate!<br/>

  O life raised from the dead by saviour Death!<br/>

  O love unconquered and invincible!<br/>

  The enemy sea had cooled her burning brain;<br/>

  Had laid to rest the heart that could not rest;<br/>

  Had hid the horror of its own dread face!<br/>

  'Twas but one desolate cry, and then her fear<br/>

  Became a blessed fact, and straight she knew<br/>

  What God knew all the time—that it was well.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01173">  O thou whose feet tread ever the wet sands<br/>

  And howling rocks along the wearing shore,<br/>

  Roaming the borders of the sea of death!<br/>

  Strain not thine eyes, bedimmed with longing tears,<br/>

  No sail comes climbing back across that line.<br/>

  Turn thee, and to thy work; let God alone,<br/>

  And wait for him: faint o'er the waves will come<br/>

  Far-floating whispers from the other shore<br/>

  To thine averted ears. Do thou thy work,<br/>

  And thou shalt follow—follow, and find thine own.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01174">  And thou who fearest something that may come;<br/>

  Around whose house the storm of terror breaks<br/>

  All night; to whose love-sharpened ear, all day,<br/>

  The Invisible is calling at the door,<br/>

  To render up a life thou canst not keep,<br/>

  Or love that will not stay,—open thy door,<br/>

  And carry out thy dying to the marge<br/>

  Of the great sea; yea, walk into the flood,<br/>

  And lay thy dead upon the moaning waves.<br/>

  Give them to God to bury; float them again,<br/>

  With sighs and prayers to waft them through the gloom,<br/>

  Back to the spring of life. Say—"If they die,<br/>

  Thou, the one life of life, art still alive,<br/>

  And thou canst make thy dead alive again!"<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01175">  Ah God, the earth is full of cries and moans,<br/>

  And dull despair, that neither moans nor cries;<br/>

  Thousands of hearts are waiting helplessly;<br/>

  The whole creation groaneth, travaileth<br/>

  For what it knows not—with a formless hope<br/>

  Of resurrection or of dreamless death!<br/>

  Raise thou the dead; restore the Aprils withered<br/>

  In hearts of maidens; give their manhood back<br/>

  To old men feebly mournful o'er a life<br/>

  That scarce hath memory but the mournfulness!<br/>

  There is no past with thee: bring back once more<br/>

  The summer eves of lovers, over which<br/>

  The wintry wind that raveth through the world<br/>

  Heaps wretched leaves in gusts of ghastly snow;<br/>

  Bring back the mother-heaven of orphans lone,<br/>

  The brother's and the sister's faithfulness;—<br/>

  Bring in the kingdom of the Son of Man.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01176">  They troop around me, children wildly crying;<br/>

  Women with faded eyes, all spent of tears;<br/>

  Men who have lived for love, yet lived alone;<br/>

  Yea, some consuming in cold fires of shame!<br/>

  O God, thou hast a work for all thy strength<br/>

  In saving these thy hearts with full content—<br/>

  Except thou give them Lethe's stream to drink,<br/>

  And that, my God, were all unworthy thee!<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01177">  Dome up, O heaven, yet higher o'er my head!<br/>

  Back, back, horizon; widen out my world!<br/>

  Rush in, O fathomless sea of the Unknown!<br/>

  For, though he slay me, I will trust in God.<br/>

  Till I forget, be near me in that chair.<br/>

  The mother's presence leads her down to sleep—<br/>

  Leaves her contented there.<br/>

  Not till I have with thee one heart, one mind;<br/>

  Not till the Life is Light in me, and then<br/>

       I tire of good men's talk;<br/>

  To me there is no joy in palms,<br/>

<p id="id01188">  I love to hear the wild winds meet,<br/>

       The wild old winds at night;<br/>

  To watch the cold stars flash and beat,<br/>

      With long-departed saint,<br/>

  A feeble dawn, without my will,<br/>

<p id="id01214">  One hopeless hope there yet may be<br/>

<p id="id01265">  I turn me to the gospel-tale:—<br/>

      My hope is faint with fear<br/>

  That hungriest search will not avail<br/>

      To find a refuge here.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01266">  A misty wind blows bare and rude<br/>

      From dead seas of the past;<br/>

  And through the clouds that halt and brood,<br/>

      Dim dawns a shape at last:<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01267">  A sad worn man who bows his face,<br/>

      And treads a frightful path,<br/>

  To save an abject hopeless race<br/>

      From an eternal wrath.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01268">  Kind words he speaks—but all the time<br/>

      As from a formless height<br/>

  To which no human foot can climb—<br/>

      Half-swathed in ancient night.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01269">  Nay, sometimes, and to gentle heart,<br/>

      Unkind words from him go!<br/>

  Surely it is no saviour's part<br/>

      To speak to women so!<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01270">  Much rather would I refuge take<br/>

      With Mary, dear to me,<br/>

  To whom that rough hard speech he spake—<br/>

      <i>What have I to do with thee</i>?<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01271">  Surely I know men tenderer,<br/>

      Women of larger soul,<br/>

  Who need no prayer their hearts to stir,<br/>

      Who always would make whole!<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01272">  Oftenest he looks a weary saint,<br/>

      Embalmed in pallid gleam;<br/>

  Listless and sad, without complaint,<br/>

      Like dead man in a dream.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01273">  And, at the best, he is uplift<br/>

      A spectacle, a show:—<br/>

  The worth of such an outworn gift<br/>

      I know too much to know!<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01274">  How find the love to pay my debt?—<br/>

      He leads me from the sun!—<br/>

  Yet it is hard men should forget<br/>

      A good deed ever done!—<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01275">  Forget that he, to foil a curse,<br/>

      Did, on that altar-hill,<br/>

  Sun of a sunless universe,<br/>

      Hang dying, patient, still!<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01276">  But what is He, whose pardon slow<br/>

      At so much blood is priced?—<br/>

  If such thou art, O Jove, I go<br/>

      To the Promethean Christ!<br/>
</p>

<h4 id="id01277" style="margin-top: 2em">XII.</h4>

<p id="id01278">  A word within says I am to blame,<br/>

      And therefore must confess;<br/>

  Must call my doing by its name,<br/>

      And so make evil less.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01279">  "I could not his false triumph bear,<br/>

      For he was first in wrong."<br/>

  "Thy own ill-doings are thy care,<br/>

      His to himself belong."<br/>

      Some sorrow for the ill."<br/>

      And they are in thy will."<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01281">  The struggle comes. Evil or I<br/>

      Must gain the victory now.<br/>

  I am unmoved and yet would try:<br/>

      O God, to thee I bow.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01282">  The skies are brass; there falls no aid;<br/>

      No wind of help will blow.<br/>

  But I bethink me:—I am made<br/>

      A man: I rise and go.<br/>
</p>

<h4 id="id01283" style="margin-top: 2em">XIII.</h4>

<p id="id01284">  To Christ I needs must come, they say;<br/>

<p id="id01285">  He is afar; the story old<br/>

      Is blotted, worn, and dim;<br/>

  With thee, O God, I can be bold—<br/>

      I cannot pray to him.<br/>

<p id="id01286">  <i>Pray</i>! At the word a cloudy grief<br/>

      To heed my crying sore;<br/>

  If in the great world anywhere<br/>

      An ear keeps open door!<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01288">  An unborn faith I will not nurse,<br/>

      Pursue an endless task;<br/>

<p id="id01289">  Is there no God—earth, sky, and sea<br/>

      Are but a chaos wild!<br/>

  Is there a God—I know that he<br/>

      Must hear his calling child!<br/>
</p>

<h4 id="id01290" style="margin-top: 2em">XIV.</h4>

<p id="id01291">  I kneel. But all my soul is dumb<br/>

      With hopeless misery:<br/>

  Is he a friend who will not come,<br/>

      Whose face I must not see?<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01292">  I do not think of broken laws,<br/>

      Of judge's damning word;<br/>

  My heart is all one ache, because<br/>

      I call and am not heard.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01293">  A cry where there is none to hear,<br/>

      Doubles the lonely pain;<br/>

  Returns in silence on the ear,<br/>

      In torture on the brain.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01294">  No look of love a smile can bring,<br/>

      No kiss wile back the breath<br/>

  To cold lips: I no answer wring<br/>

      From this great face of death.<br/>
</p>

<h4 id="id01295" style="margin-top: 2em">XV.</h4>

<p id="id01296">  Yet sometimes when the agony<br/>

      Dies of its own excess,<br/>

  A dew-like calm descends on me,<br/>

      A shadow of tenderness;<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01297">  A sense of bounty and of grace,<br/>

      A cool air in my breast,<br/>

  As if my soul were yet a place<br/>

      Where peace might one day rest.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01298">  God! God! I say, and cry no more,<br/>

      But rise, and think to stand<br/>

  Unwearied at the closed door<br/>

      Till comes the opening hand.<br/>
</p>

<h4 id="id01299" style="margin-top: 2em">XVI.</h4>

<p id="id01300">  But is it God?—Once more the fear<br/>

      Of <i>No God</i> loads my breath:<br/>

  Amid a sunless atmosphere<br/>

      I fight again with death.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01301">  Such rest may be like that which lulls<br/>

      The man who fainting lies:<br/>

  His bloodless brain his spirit dulls,<br/>

      Draws darkness o'er his eyes.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01302">  But even such sleep, my heart responds,<br/>

      May be the ancient rest<br/>

  Rising released from bodily bonds,<br/>

      And flowing unreprest.<br/>

<p id="id01303">  The o'ertasked will falls down aghast<br/>

      In individual death;<br/>

  God puts aside the severed past,<br/>

      Breathes-in a primal breath.<br/>

<p id="id01304">  For how should torture breed a calm?<br/>

      Can death to life give birth?<br/>

  No labour can create the balm<br/>

      That soothes the sleeping earth!<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01305">  I yet will hope the very One<br/>

      Whose love is life in me,<br/>

  Did, when my strength was overdone,<br/>

<p id="id01308">  When poet's heart is in eclipse,<br/>

      A glance from childhood's eye,<br/>

  A smile from passing maiden's lips,<br/>

</p>

<p id="id01309">  Might not from God such influence come<br/>

      A dying hope to lift?<br/>

<p id="id01314">  But why from thought should fresh doubt start—<br/>

      An ever-lengthening cord?<br/>

  Might he not make my troubled heart<br/>

      Right sure it was the Lord?<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01315">  God will not let a smaller boon<br/>

			<h2 epub:type="title">The Child-Mother</h2>
<p id="id02620" style="margin-top: 2em">  Heavily slumbered noonday bright<br/>

  Upon the lone field, glory-dight,<br/>

    A burnished grassy sea:<br/>

  The child, in gorgeous golden hours,<br/>

  Through heaven-descended starry flowers,<br/>

    Went walking on the lea.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id02621">  Velvety bees make busy hum;<br/>

  Green flies and striped wasps go and come;<br/>

    The butterflies gleam white;<br/>

  Blue-burning, vaporous, to and fro<br/>

  The dragon-flies like arrows go,<br/>

    Or hang in moveless flight:—<br/>
</p>

<p id="id02622">  Not one she followed; like a rill<br/>

  She wandered on with quiet will;<br/>

    Received, but did not miss;<br/>

  Her step was neither quick nor long;<br/>

  Nought but a snatch of murmured song<br/>

    Ever revealed her bliss.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id02623">  An almost solemn woman-child,<br/>

  Not fashioned frolicsome and wild,<br/>

    She had more love than glee;<br/>

  And now, though nine and nothing more,<br/>

  Another little child she bore,<br/>

    Almost as big as she.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id02624">  No silken cloud from solar harms<br/>

  Had she to spread; with shifting arms<br/>

    She dodged him from the sun;<br/>

  Mother and sister both in heart,<br/>

  She did a gracious woman's part,<br/>

    Life's task even now begun!<br/>
</p>

<p id="id02625">  They came upon a stagnant ditch,<br/>

  The slippery sloping banks of which<br/>

    More varied blossoms line;<br/>

  Some ragged-robins baby spies,<br/>

  Stretches his hands, and crows and cries,<br/>

    Plain saying, "They are mine!"<br/>
</p>

<p id="id02626">  What baby wants, that baby has—<br/>

  A law unalterable as<br/>

    The poor shall serve the rich:<br/>

  They are beyond her reach—almost!<br/>

  She kneels, she strains, and, too engrossed,<br/>

    Topples into the ditch.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id02627">  Adown the side she slanting rolled,<br/>

  But her two arms convulsive hold<br/>

    The precious baby tight;<br/>

  She lets herself sublimely go,<br/>

  And in the ditch's muddy flow<br/>

    Stands up, in evil plight.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id02628">  'Tis nothing that her feet are wet,<br/>

  But her new shoes she can't forget—<br/>

    They cost five shillings bright!<br/>

  Her petticoat, her tippet blue,<br/>

  Her frock, they're smeared with slime like glue!<br/>

    But baby is all right!<br/>
</p>

<p id="id02629">  And baby laughs, and baby crows;<br/>

  And baby being right, she knows<br/>

    That nothing can be wrong;<br/>

  So, with a troubled heart yet stout,<br/>

  She plans how <i>ever</i> to get out<br/>

    With meditation long.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id02630">  The high bank's edge is far away,<br/>

  The slope is steep, and made of clay;<br/>

    And what to do with baby?<br/>

  For even a monkey, up to run,<br/>

  Would need his four hands, every one:—<br/>

    She is perplexed as may be.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id02631">  And all her puzzling is no good!<br/>

  Blank-staring up the side she stood,<br/>

    Which, settling she, grew higher.<br/>

  At last, seized with a fresh dismay<br/>

  Lest baby's patience should give way,<br/>

    She plucked her feet from the mire,<br/>
</p>

<p id="id02632">  And up and down the ditch, not glad,<br/>

  But patient, very, did promenade—<br/>

    Splash, splash, went her small feet!<br/>

  And baby thought it rare good fun,<br/>

  Sucking his bit of pulpy bun,<br/>

    And smelling meadow-sweet.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id02633">  But, oh, the world that she had left—<br/>

  The meads from her so lately reft—<br/>

    Poor infant Proserpine!<br/>

  A fabled land they lay above,<br/>

  A paradise of sunny love,<br/>

    In breezy space divine!<br/>
</p>

<p id="id02634">  Frequent from neighbouring village-green<br/>

  Came sounds of laughter, faintly keen,<br/>

    And barks of well-known dogs,<br/>

  While she, the hot sun overhead,<br/>

  Her lonely watery way must tread<br/>

    In mud and weeds and frogs!<br/>
</p>

<p id="id02635">  Sudden, the ditch about her shakes;<br/>

  Her little heart, responsive, quakes<br/>

    With fear of uncouth woes;<br/>

  She lifts her boding eyes perforce—<br/>

  To see the huge head of a horse<br/>

    Go past upon its nose.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id02636">  Then, hark, what sounds of tearing grass<br/>

  And puffing breath!—With knobs of brass<br/>

    On horns of frightful size,<br/>

  A cow's head through the broken hedge<br/>

  Looks awful from the other edge,<br/>

    Though mild her pondering eyes.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id02637">  The horse, the cow are passed and gone;<br/>

  The sun keeps going on and on,<br/>

    And still no help comes near.—<br/>

  At misery's last—oh joy, the sound<br/>

  Of human footsteps on the ground!<br/>

    She cried aloud, "<i>I</i>'m here!"<br/>
</p>

<p id="id02638">  It was a man—oh, heavenly joy!<br/>

  He looked amazed at girl and boy,<br/>

    And reached his hand so strong:<br/>

  "Give me the child," he said; but no!<br/>

  Care would not let the burden go<br/>

    Which Love had borne so long.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id02639">  Smiling he kneels with outstretched hands,<br/>

  And them unparted safely lands<br/>

    In the upper world again.<br/>

  Her low thanks feebly murmured, she<br/>

  Drags her legs homeward painfully—<br/>

    Poor, wet, one-chickened hen!<br/>
</p>

<p id="id02640">  Arrived at length—Lo, scarce a speck<br/>

  Was on the child from heel to neck,<br/>

    Though she was sorely mired!<br/>

  No tear confessed the long-drawn rack,<br/>

  Till her mother took the baby back,<br/>

    And the she cried, "I'm tired!"<br/>
</p>

<p id="id02641">  And, intermixed with sobbing wail,<br/>

  She told her mother all the tale,<br/>

    Her wet cheeks in a glow:<br/>

  "But, mother, mother, though I fell,<br/>

  I kept the baby pretty well—<br/>

    I did not let him go!"<br/>

<p id="id01778" style="margin-top: 2em">    <i>All sights and sounds of day and year,<br/>

  All groups and forms, each leaf and gem,<br/>

  Are thine, O God, nor will I fear<br/>

  To talk to thee of them</i>.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01779">      Too great thy heart is to despise,<br/>

  Whose day girds centuries about;<br/>

  From things which we name small, thine eyes<br/>

  See great things looking out.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01780">      Therefore the prayerful song I sing<br/>

  May come to thee in ordered words:<br/>

  Though lowly born, it needs not cling<br/>

  In terror to its chords.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01781">      I think that nothing made is lost;<br/>

  That not a moon has ever shone,<br/>

  That not a cloud my eyes hath crossed<br/>

  But to my soul is gone.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01782">      That all the lost years garnered lie<br/>

  In this thy casket, my dim soul;<br/>

  And thou wilt, once, the key apply,<br/>

  And show the shining whole.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01783">      <i>But were they dead in me, they live<br/>

  In thee, whose Parable is—Time,<br/>

  And Worlds, and Forms—all things that give<br/>

  Me thoughts, and this my rime</i>.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01784">      <i>And after what men call my death,<br/>

  When I have crossed the unknown sea,<br/>

  Some heavenly morn, on hopeful breath,<br/>

  Shall rise this prayer to thee</i>.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01785">      Oh let me be a child once more,<br/>

  And dream fine glories in the gloom,<br/>

  Of sun and moon and stars in store<br/>

  To ceil my humble room.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01786">      Oh call again the moons that crossed<br/>

  Blue gulfs, behind gray vapours crept;<br/>

  Show me the solemn skies I lost<br/>

  Because in thee I slept.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01787">      Once more let gathering glory swell,<br/>

  And lift the world's dim eastern eye;<br/>

  Once more let lengthening shadows tell<br/>

  Its time is come to die.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01788">      But show me first—oh, blessed sight!<br/>

  The lowly house where I was young;<br/>

  There winter sent wild winds at night,<br/>

  And up the snow-heaps flung;<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01789">      Or soundless brought a chaos fair,<br/>

  Full, formless, of fantastic forms,<br/>

  White ghostly trees in sparkling air—<br/>

  Chamber for slumbering storms.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01790">      There sudden dawned a dewy morn;<br/>

  A man was turning up the mould;<br/>

  And in our hearts the spring was born,<br/>

  Crept thither through the cold.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01791">      <i>And Spring, in after years of youth,<br/>

  Became the form of every form<br/>

  For hearts now bursting into truth,<br/>

  Now sighing in the storm</i>.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01792">      On with the glad year let me go,<br/>

  With troops of daisies round my feet;<br/>

  Flying my kite, or, in the glow<br/>

  Of arching summer heat,<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01793">      Outstretched in fear upon a bank,<br/>

  Lest, gazing up on awful space,<br/>

  I should fall down into the blank,<br/>

  From off the round world's face.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01794">      And let my brothers come with me<br/>

  To play our old games yet again,<br/>

  Children on earth, more full of glee<br/>

  That we in heaven are men.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01795">      If then should come the shadowy death,<br/>

  Take one of us and go,<br/>

  We left would say, under our breath,<br/>

  "It is a dream, you know!"<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01796">      "And in the dream our brother's gone<br/>

  Upstairs: he heard our father call;<br/>

  Till he has gathered all."<br/>

<p id="id01800">      On with my history let me go,<br/>

  Gather great noontide's joyous glow,<br/>

  Eve's love-contented tears;<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01801">      One afternoon sit pondering<br/>

  In that old chair, in that old room,<br/>

  Where passing pigeon's sudden wing<br/>

  Flashed lightning through the gloom;<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01802">      There try once more, with effort vain,<br/>

  To mould in one perplexed things;<br/>

  There find the solace yet again<br/>

  Hope in the Father brings;<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01803">      Or mount and ride in sun and wind,<br/>

  Through desert moors, hills bleak and high,<br/>

  Where wandering vapours fall, and find<br/>

  In me another sky!<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01804">      <i>For so thy Visible grew mine,<br/>

<p id="id01805">     Giving me cups that would not spill,<br/>

  But water carry and yield again;<br/>

  New bottles with new wine to fill<br/>

  For comfort of thy men.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01806">      But if thou thus restore the past<br/>

  One hour, for me to wander in,<br/>

  I now bethink me at the last—<br/>

  O Lord, leave out the sin.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01807">      <i>And with the thought comes doubt, my God:<br/>

  Shall I the whole desire to see,<br/>

  Away from the noisy street!
Away from the storm of words,
  Where hateful and hating meet!

Away from the vapour grey,
  That like a boding of ill
Is blotting the morning gay,
  And gathers and darkens still!

Away from the stupid book!
  For, like the fog's weary rest,
With anger dull it fills each nook
  Of my aching and misty breast.

Over some shining shore,
  There hangeth a space of blue;
A parting 'mid thin clouds hoar
  Where the sunlight is falling through.

The glad waves are kissing the shore
  Rejoice, and tell it for ever;
The boat glides on, while its oar
  Is flashing out of the river.

Oh to be there with thee!
  Thou and I only, my love!
The sparkling, sands and the sea!

			<h2 epub:type="title">My Eyes Make Pictures</h2>
"My eyes make pictures, when they are shut."
    COLERIDGE.

Fair morn, I bring my greeting
  To lofty skies, and pale,
Save where cloud-shreds are fleeting
  Before the driving gale,
The weary branches tossing,
  Careless of autumn's grief,
Shadow and sunlight crossing
  On each earth-spotted leaf.

I will escape their grieving;
  And so I close my eyes,
And see the light boat heaving
  Where the billows fall and rise;
I see the sunlight glancing
  Upon its silvery sail,
Where a youth's wild heart is dancing,
  And a maiden growing pale.

And I am quietly pacing
  The smooth stones o'er and o'er,
Where the merry waves are chasing
  Each other to the shore.
Words come to me while listening
  Where the rocks and waters meet,
And the little shells are glistening
  In sand-pools at my feet.

Away! the white sail gleaming!
  Again I close my eyes,
And the autumn light is streaming
  From pale blue cloudless skies;
Upon the lone hill falling
  'Mid the sound of heather-bells,
Where the running stream is calling
  Unto the silent wells.

Along the pathway lonely,
  My horse and I move slow;
No living thing, save only
  The home-returning crow.
And the moon, so large, is peering
  Up through the white cloud foam;
And I am gladly nearing
  My father's house, my home.

As I were gently dreaming
  The solemn trees look out;
The hills, the waters seeming
  In still sleep round about;
And in my soul are ringing
  Tones of a spirit-lyre,
As my beloved were singing
  Amid a sister-choir.

If peace were in my spirit,
  How oft I'd close my eyes,
And all the earth inherit,
  And all the changeful skies!
Thus leave the sermon dreary,
  Thus leave the lonely hearth;
No more a spirit weary--
  A free one of the earth!

<p id="id02071">  Summer is come again. The sun is bright,<br/>

  And the soft wind is breathing. Airy joy<br/>

  Is sparkling in thine eyes, and in their light<br/>

  My soul is shining. Come; our day's employ<br/>

  Shall be to revel in unlikely things,<br/>

  In gayest hopes, fondest imaginings,<br/>

  And make-believes of bliss. Come, we will talk<br/>

  Of waning moons, low winds, and a dim sea;<br/>

  Till this fair summer, deepening as we walk,<br/>

  Has grown a paradise for you and me.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id02072">  But ah, those leaves!—it was not summer's mouth<br/>

  Breathed such a gold upon them. And look there—<br/>

  That beech how red! See, through its boughs, half-bare,<br/>

  How low the sun lies in the mid-day south!—<br/>

  The sweetness is but one pined memory flown<br/>

  Back from our summer, wandering alone!<br/>

  See, see the dead leaves falling! Hear thy heart,<br/>

  Which, with the year's pulse beating swift or slow,<br/>

  Takes in the changing world its changing part,<br/>

  Return a sigh, an echo sad and low,<br/>

  To the faint, scarcely audible sound<br/>

  With which the leaf goes whispering to the ground!<br/>

  O love, sad winter lieth at the door—<br/>

  Behind sad winter, age—we know no more.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id02073">  Come round me, dear hearts. All of us will hold<br/>

  Each of us compassed: we are growing old;<br/>

  And if we be not as a ring enchanted,<br/>

  Hearts around heart, with love to keep it gay,<br/>

  The young, who claim the joy that haunted<br/>

  Our visions once, will push us far away<br/>

  Into the desolate regions, dim and gray,<br/>

  Where the sea moans, and hath no other cry,<br/>

  The clouds hang low, and have no tears,<br/>

  Old dreams lie mouldering in a pit of years,<br/>

  And hopes and songs all careless pass us by.<br/>

  But if all each do keep,<br/>

  The rising tide of youth will sweep<br/>

  Around us with its laughter-joyous waves,<br/>

  As ocean fair some palmy island laves,<br/>

  To loneliness heaved slow from out the deep;<br/>

  And our youth hover round us like the breath<br/>

  Of one that sleeps, and sleepeth not to death.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id02074">  Thus ringed eternally, to parted graves,<br/>

  The sundered doors into one palace home,<br/>

  Stumbling through age's thickets, we will go,<br/>

  Faltering but faithful—willing to lie low,<br/>

  Willing to part, not willing to deny<br/>

  The lovely past, where all the futures lie.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id02075">  Oh! if thou be, who of the live art lord,<br/>

  Not of the dead—Lo, by that self-same word,<br/>

  Thou art not lord of age, but lord of youth—<br/>

  Because there is no age, in sooth,<br/>

  Beyond its passing shows!<br/>

  A mist o'er life's dimmed lantern grows;<br/>

  Thou break'st the glass, out streams the light<br/>

  That knows not youth nor age,<br/>

  That fears no darkness nor the rage<br/>

  Of windy tempests—burning still more bright<br/>

  Than when glad youth was all about,<br/>

  And summer winds were out!<br/>

		<article id="the-death-of-the-old-year" epub:type="z3998:poem">
			<h2 epub:type="title">The Death of the Old Year</h2>
The weary Old Year is dead at last;
His corpse 'mid the ruins of Time is cast,
Where the mouldering wrecks of lost Thought lie,
And the rich-hued blossoms of Passion die
To a withering grass that droops o'er his grave,
The shadowy Titan's refuge cave.
Strange lights from pale moony Memory lie
On the weedy columns beneath its eye;
And strange is the sound of the ghostlike breeze,
In the lingering leaves on the skeleton trees;
And strange is the sound of the falling shower,
When the clouds of dead pain o'er the spirit lower;
Unheard in the home he inhabiteth,
The land where all lost things are gathered by Death.

Alone I reclined in the closing year;
Voice, nor breathing, nor step was near;
And I said in the weariness of my breast:
Weary Old Year, thou art going to rest;
O weary Old Year, I would I might be
One hour alone in thy dying with thee!
Would thou wert a spirit, whose low lament
Might mix with the sighs from my spirit sent;
For I am weary of man and life;
Weary of restless unchanging strife;
Weary of change that is ever changing;
Weary of thought that is ever ranging,
Ever falling in efforts vain,
Fluttering, upspringing from earth again,
Struggling once more through the darkness to wing
That hangs o'er the birthplace of everything,
And choked yet again in the vapour's breast,
Sinking once more to a helpless rest.
I am weary of tears that scarce are dry,
Ere their founts are filled as the cloud goes by;
Weary of feelings where each in the throng
Mocks at the rest as they crowd along;
Where Pride over all, like a god on high,
Sits enshrined in his self-complacency;
Where Selfishness crawls, the snake-demon of ill,
The least suspected where busiest still;
Where all things evil and painful entwine,
And all in their hate and their sorrow are mine:
O weary Old Year, I would I might be
One hour by thy dying, to weep with thee!

Peace, the soul's slumber, was round me shed;
The sleep where thought lives, but its pain is dead;
And my musings led me, a spirit-band,
Through the wide realms of their native land;
Till I stood by the couch of the mighty dying,
A lonely shore in the midnight lying.
He lay as if he had laid him to sleep,
And the stars above him their watch did keep;
And the mournful wind with the dreamy sigh,
The homeless wanderer of the sky,
Was the only attendant whose gentle breath
Soothed him yet on the couch of death;
And the dying waves of the heedless sea
Fell at his feet most listlessly.

But he lay in peace, with his solemn eye
Looking far through the mists of futurity.
A smile gleamed over the death-dew that lay
On his withered cheek as life ebbed away.
A darkness lay on his forehead vast;
But the light of expectancy o'er it was cast,--
A light that shone from the coming day,
Travelling unseen to the East away.
In his cloudy robes that lay shadowing wide,
I stretched myself motionless by his side;
And his eyes with their calm, unimpassioned power,
Soothing my heart like an evening shower,
Led in a spectral, far-billowing train,
The hours of the Past through my spirit again.

There were fears of evil whose stony eyes
Froze joy in its gushing melodies.
Some floated afar on thy tranquil wave,
And the heart looked up from its search for a grave;
While others as guests to the bosom came,
And left its wild children more sorrow, less shame;
For the death-look parts from their chilling brow,
And they bless the heads that before them bow;
And floating away in the far-off gloom.
Thankfulness follows them to their tomb.
There were Hopes that found not a place to rest
Their foot 'mid the rush of all-ocean's breast;
And home to the sickening heart flew back,
But changed into sorrows upon their track;
And through the moan of the darkening sea
Bearing no leaf from the olive-tree.
There were joys that looked forth with their maiden eyes,
And smiled, and were gone, with a sad surprise;
And the Love of the Earthly, whose beauteous form
Beckoned me on through sunshine and storm;
But when the bounding heart sprang high,
Meeting her smile with a speechless sigh,
The arms sunk home with a painful start,
Clasping a vacancy to the heart.

And the voice of the dying I seem to hear
But whether his breathing is in mine ear,
Or the sounds of the breaking billows roll
The lingering accents upon my soul,
I know not; but thus they seem to bear
Reproof to my soul for its faint despair:--
Blame not life, it is scarce begun;
Blame not mankind, thyself art one.
And change is holy, oh! blame it never;
Thy soul shall live by its changing ever;
Not the bubbling change of a stagnant pool,
But the change of a river, flowing and full;
Where all that is noble and good will grow
Mightier still as the full tides flow;
Till it joins the hidden, the boundless sea,
Rolling through depths of Eternity.
Blame not thy thought that it cannot reach
That which the Infinite must teach;
Bless thy God that the Word came nigh
To guide thee home to thy native sky,
Where all things are homely and glorious too,
And the children are wondering, and glad, and true.

And he pointed away to an Eastern star,
That gleamed through his robes o'er the ocean afar;
And I knew that a star had looked o'er the rim
Of my world that lay all dreary and dim;
And was slowly dissolving the darkness deep
Which, like evil nurse, had soothed me to sleep;
And rising higher, and shining clearer,
Would draw the day-spring ever nearer,
Till the sunshine of God burst full on the morn,
And every hill and valley would start
With the joy of light and new gratitude born
To Him who had led me home to His heart;
And all things that lived in my world within
With the gladness of tears to His feet come in;
And the false Self be banished with fiends to dwell
In the gloomiest haunts of his native hell;
And Pride, that ruled like a god above,
Be trod 'neath the feet of triumphant Love.

And again he pointed across the sea,
And another vision arose in me:
And I knew I walked an ocean of fear,
Yet of safety too, for the Master was near;
And every wave of sorrow or dread,
O'er which strong faith should upraise my head,
Would show from the height of its troubled crest
Still nearer and nearer the Land of Rest.
And when the storm-spray on the wind should arise,
And with tears unbidden should blind mine eyes,
And hide from my vision the Home of Love,
I knew I must look to the star above,
And the mists of Passion would quickly flee,
And the storm would faint to serenity.

And again it seemed as if words found scope,
The sorrowing words of a farewell Hope:
"I will meet thee again in that deathless land,
Whenever thy foot shall imprint the strand;
And the loveliest things that have here been mine,
Shall there in eternal beauty shine;
For there I shall live and never die,
Part of a glorious Eternity;
For the death of Time is _To be forgot,_
And I go where oblivion entereth not."

He was dead. He had gone to the rest of his race,
With a sad smile frozen upon his face.
Deadness clouded his eyes. And his death-bell rung,
And my sorrowing thoughts his low requiem sung;
And with trembling steps his worn body cast
In the wide charnel-house of the dreary Past.
Thus met the noble Old Year his end:
Rest him in peace, for he was my friend.

As my thoughts returned from their wandering,
A voice in my spirit was lingering;
And its sounds were like Spring's first breeze's hum,
When the oak-leaves fall, and the young leaves come:

Time dieth ever, is ever born:
On the footsteps of night so treadeth the morn;
Shadow and brightness, death and birth,
Chasing each other o'er the round earth.
But the spirit of Time from his tomb is springing,
The dust of decay from his pinions flinging;
Ever renewing his glorious youth,
Scattering around him the dew of Truth.
Oh, let it raise in the desert heart
Fountains and flowers that shall never depart!
This spirit will fill us with thought sublime;
For the _End of God_ is the spirit of Time.

			<h2 epub:type="title">A Thanksgiving</h2>
I Thank Thee, boundless Giver,
  That the thoughts Thou givest flow
In sounds that like a river
  All through the darkness go.
And though few should swell the pleasure,
  By sharing this my wine,
My heart will clasp its treasure,
  This secret gift of Thine.

My heart the joy inherits,
  And will oft be sung to rest;
And some wandering hoping spirits
  May listen and be blest.
For the sound may break the hours
  In a dark and gloomy mood,
As the wind breaks up the bowers
  Of the brooding sunless wood.

For every sound of gladness
  Is a prophet-wind that tells
Of a summer without sadness,
  And a love without farewells;
And a heart that hath no ailing,
  And an eye that is not dim,
And a faith that without failing
  Shall be complete in Him.

And when my heart is mourning,
  The songs it lately gave,
Back to their fount returning,
  Make sweet the bitter wave;
And forth a new stream floweth,
  In sunshine winding fair;
And through the dark wood goeth
  Glad laughter on the air.

For the heart of man that waketh,
  Yet hath not ceased to dream,
Is the only fount that maketh
  The sweet and bitter stream.
But the sweet will still be flowing
  When the bitter stream is dry,
And glad music only going
  On the breezes of the sky.

I thank Thee, boundless Giver,
  That the thoughts Thou givest flow
In sounds that like a river
  All through the darkness go.
And though few should swell the pleasure
  By sharing this my wine,
My heart will clasp its treasure,
  This secret gift of Thine.

<h5 id="id01421">I.</h5>

<p id="id01422">  Mary, to thee the heart was given<br/>

  For infant hand to hold,<br/>

  And clasp thus, an eternal heaven,<br/>

  The great earth in its fold.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01423">  He seized the world with tender might<br/>

  By making thee his own;<br/>

  Thee, lowly queen, whose heavenly height<br/>

  Was to thyself unknown.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01424">  He came, all helpless, to thy power,<br/>

  For warmth, and love, and birth;<br/>

  In thy embraces, every hour,<br/>

  He grew into the earth.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01425">  Thine was the grief, O mother high,<br/>

  Which all thy sisters share<br/>

  Who keep the gate betwixt the sky<br/>

  And this our lower air;<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01426">  But unshared sorrows, gathering slow,<br/>

  Will rise within thy heart,<br/>

  Strange thoughts which like a sword will go<br/>

  Thorough thy inward part.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01427">  For, if a woman bore a son<br/>

  That was of angel brood,<br/>

  Who lifted wings ere day was done,<br/>

  And soared from where she stood,<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01428">  Wild grief would rave on love's high throne;<br/>

  She, sitting in the door,<br/>

  All day would cry: "He was my own,<br/>

  And now is mine no more!"<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01429">  So thou, O Mary, years on years,<br/>

  From child-birth to the cross,<br/>

  Wast filled with yearnings, filled with fears,<br/>

  Keen sense of love and loss.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01430">  His childish thoughts outsoared thy reach;<br/>

  His godlike tenderness<br/>

  Would sometimes seem, in human speech,<br/>

  To thee than human less.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01431">  Strange pangs await thee, mother mild,<br/>

  A sorer travail-pain;<br/>

  Then will the spirit of thy child<br/>

  Be born in thee again.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01432">  Till then thou wilt forebode and dread;<br/>

  Loss will be still thy fear—<br/>

  Till he be gone, and, in his stead,<br/>

  His very self appear.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01433">  For, when thy son hath reached his goal,<br/>

  And vanished from the earth,<br/>

  Soon wilt thou find him in thy soul,<br/>

  A second, holier birth.<br/>
</p>

<h4 id="id01434" style="margin-top: 2em">II.</h4>

<p id="id01435">  Ah, there he stands! With wondering face<br/>

  Old men surround the boy;<br/>

  The solemn looks, the awful place<br/>

  Bestill the mother's joy.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01436">  In sweet reproach her gladness hid,<br/>

  Her trembling voice says—low,<br/>

  Less like the chiding than the chid—<br/>

  "How couldst thou leave us so?"<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01437">  But will her dear heart understand<br/>

  The answer that he gives—<br/>

  Was born without a smile.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01444">  He saw the pitchers, high upturned,<br/>

<p id="id01447">  A vision rose before his eyes,<br/>

  The cross, the waiting tomb,<br/>

			<h2 epub:type="title">A Song in a Dream</h2>
I dreamed of a song, I heard it sung;
In the ear that sleeps not its music rung.
And the tones were upheld by harmonies deep,
Where the spirit floated; yea, soared, on their sweep
With each wild unearthly word and tone,
Upward, it knew not whither bound,
In a calm delirium of mystic sound--
Up, where the Genius of Thought alone
Loveth in silence to drink his fill
Of dews that from unknown clouds distil.
A woman's voice the deep echoes awoke,
In the caverns and solitudes of my soul;
But such a voice had never broke
Through the sea of sounds that about us roll,
Choking the ear in the daylight strife.
There was sorrow and triumph, and death and life
In each chord-note of that prophet-song,
Blended in one harmonious throng:
Such a chant, ere my voice has fled from death,
Be it mine to mould of the parting breath.

<p id="id02266">  A glory on the chamber wall!<br/>

    A glory in the brain!<br/>

  Triumphant floods of glory fall<br/>

    On heath, and wold, and plain.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id02267">  Earth lieth still in hopeless bliss;<br/>

    She has, and seeks no more;<br/>

  Forgets that days come after this,<br/>

    Forgets the days before.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id02268">  Each ripple waves a flickering fire<br/>

    Of gladness, as it runs;<br/>

  They laugh and flash, and leap and spire,<br/>

    And toss ten thousand suns.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id02269">  But hark! low, in the world within,<br/>

    One sad aeolian tone:<br/>

  "Ah! shall we ever, ever win<br/>

    A summer of our own?"<br/>
</p>

<h4 id="id02270" style="margin-top: 2em">  II.</h4>

<p id="id02271">  A morn of winds and swaying trees—<br/>

    Earth's jubilance rushing out!<br/>

  The birds are fighting with the breeze;<br/>

    The waters heave about.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id02272">  White clouds are swept across the sky,<br/>

    Their shadows o'er the graves;<br/>

  Purpling the green, they float and fly<br/>

    Athwart the sunny waves.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id02273">  The long grass—an earth-rooted sea—<br/>

    Mimics the watery strife.<br/>

  To boat or horse? Wild motion we<br/>

    Shall find harmonious life.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id02274">  But whither? Roll and sweep and bend<br/>

    Suffice for Nature's part;<br/>

  But motion to an endless end<br/>

    Is needful for our heart.<br/>
</p>

<h4 id="id02275" style="margin-top: 2em">  III.</h4>

<p id="id02276">  The morn awakes like brooding dove,<br/>

    With outspread wings of gray;<br/>

  Her feathery clouds close in above,<br/>

    And roof a sober day.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id02277">  No motion in the deeps of air!<br/>

    No trembling in the leaves!<br/>

  A still contentment everywhere,<br/>

    That neither laughs nor grieves!<br/>
</p>

<p id="id02278">  A film of sheeted silver gray<br/>

    Shuts in the ocean's hue;<br/>

  White-winged feluccas cleave their way<br/>

    In paths of gorgeous blue.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id02279">  Dream on, dream on, O dreamy day,<br/>

    Thy very clouds are dreams!<br/>

  Yon child is dreaming far away—<br/>

    He sings the morning prayer.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id02282">  Slow clouds from north and south appear,<br/>

    Black-based, with shining slope;<br/>

  In sullen forms their might they rear,<br/>

    And climb the vaulted cope.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id02283">  A lightning flash, a thunder boom!—<br/>

    Nor sun nor clouds are there;<br/>

  A single, all-pervading gloom<br/>

    Hangs in the heavy air.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id02284">  A weeping, wasting afternoon<br/>

    Weighs down the aspiring corn;<br/>

  Amber and red, the sunset soon<br/>

    Leads back to golden morn.<br/>

<p id="id02287">  The dreary wind of night is out,<br/>

    Homeless and wandering slow;<br/>

  O'er pale seas moaning like a doubt,<br/>

    It breathes, but will not blow.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id02288">  It sighs from out the helpless past,<br/>

    Where doleful things abide;<br/>

  Gray ghosts of dead thought sail aghast<br/>

    Across its ebbing tide.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id02289">  O'er marshy pools it faints and flows,<br/>

    All deaf and dumb and blind;<br/>

  O'er moor and mountain aimless goes—<br/>

    The listless woesome wind!<br/>
</p>

<p id="id02290">  Nay, nay!—breathe on, sweet wind of night!<br/>

    The sigh is all in me;<br/>

  Flow, fan, and blow, with gentle might,<br/>

    Until I wake and see.<br/>
</p>

<h4 id="id02291" style="margin-top: 2em">  II.</h4>

<p id="id02292">  The west is broken into bars<br/>

    Of orange, gold, and gray;<br/>

  Gone is the sun, fast come the stars,<br/>

    And night infolds the day.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id02293">  My boat glides with the gliding stream,<br/>

    Following adown its breast<br/>

  One flowing mirrored amber gleam,<br/>

    The death-smile of the west.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id02294">  The river moves; the sky is still,<br/>

    No ceaseless quest it knows:<br/>

  Thy bosom swells, thy fair eyes fill<br/>

    At sight of its repose.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id02295">  The ripples run; all patient sit<br/>

    The stars above the night.<br/>

  In shade and gleam the waters flit:<br/>

    The heavens are changeless bright!<br/>
</p>

<h4 id="id02296" style="margin-top: 2em">  III.</h4>

<p id="id02297">  Alone I lie, buried amid<br/>

    The long luxurious grass;<br/>

  The bats flit round me, born and hid<br/>

    In twilight's wavering mass.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id02298">  The fir-top floats, an airy isle,<br/>

    High o'er the mossy ground;<br/>

  Harmonious silence breathes the while<br/>

    In scent instead of sound.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id02299">  The flaming rose glooms swarthy red;<br/>

    The borage gleams more blue;<br/>

  Dim-starred with white, a flowery bed<br/>

    Glimmers the rich dusk through.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id02300">  Hid in the summer grass I lie,<br/>

    Lost in the great blue cave;<br/>

  My body gazes at the sky,<br/>

    And measures out its grave.<br/>

<h4 id="id02301" style="margin-top: 2em">  IV.</h4>

<p id="id02302">  What art thou, gathering dusky cool,<br/>

    In slow gradation fine?<br/>

  Death's lovely shadow, flickering full<br/>

    Of eyes about to shine.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id02303">  When weary Day goes down below,<br/>

    Thou leanest o'er his grave,<br/>

  Revolving all the vanished show<br/>

    The gracious splendour gave.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id02304">  Or art thou not she rather—say—<br/>

    Dark-browed, with luminous eyes,<br/>

  Of whom is born the mighty Day,<br/>

    That fights and saves and dies?<br/>

<p id="id02305">  For action sleeps with sleeping light;<br/>

    Calm thought awakes with thee:<br/>

<p id="id02308">  We bore him through the golden land,<br/>

    One early harvest morn;<br/>

  The corn stood ripe on either hand—<br/>

    He knew all about the corn.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id02309">  How shall the harvest gathered be<br/>

    Without him standing by?<br/>

  Without him walking on the lea,<br/>

    The sky is scarce a sky.<br/>

<p id="id02310">  The year's glad work is almost done;<br/>

    The land is rich in fruit;<br/>

  Yellow it floats in air and sun—<br/>

    Earth holds it by the root.<br/>

<p id="id02311">  Why should earth hold it for a day<br/>

    When harvest-time is come?<br/>

  Death is triumphant o'er decay,<br/>

    And leads the ripened home.<br/>

<p id="id02313">  And though the sun be not so warm,<br/>

    His shining is not lost;<br/>

  Both corn and hope, of heart and farm,<br/>

    Lie hid from coming frost.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id02314">  The sombre woods are richly sad,<br/>

    Their leaves are red and gold:<br/>

  Are thoughts in solemn splendour clad<br/>

    Signs that we men grow old?<br/>
</p>

<p id="id02315">  Strange odours haunt the doubtful brain<br/>

    From fields and days gone by;<br/>

  And mournful memories again<br/>

    Are born, are loved, and die.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id02316">  The mornings clear, the evenings cool<br/>

    Foretell no wintry wars;<br/>

  The day of dying leaves is full,<br/>

<p id="id02319">  Red fruit has followed golden corn;<br/>

    The leaves are few and sere;<br/>

  My thoughts are old as soon as born,<br/>

    And chill with coming fear.<br/>

<p id="id02320">  The winds lie sick; no softest breath<br/>

    Floats through the branches bare;<br/>

  A silence as of coming death<br/>

    Is growing in the air.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id02321">  But what must fade can bear to fade—<br/>

    Was born to meet the ill:<br/>

  Creep on, old Winter, deathly shade!<br/>

    We sorrow, and are still.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id02323">  There is no longer any heaven<br/>

    To glorify our clouds;<br/>

  The rising vapours downward driven<br/>

    Come home in palls and shrouds.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id02324">  The sun himself is ill bested<br/>

    A heavenly sign to show;<br/>

  His radiance, dimmed to glowing red,<br/>

    Can hardly further go.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id02325">  An earthy damp, a churchyard gloom,<br/>

    Pervade the moveless air;<br/>

  The year is sinking to its tomb,<br/>

    And death is everywhere.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id02326">  But while sad thoughts together creep,<br/>

    Like bees too cold to sting,<br/>

  God's children, in their beds asleep,<br/>

    As round it all things had been good.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id02655">  Was the boy deaf—the tender palm<br/>

    Of him that made him folded round<br/>

  The little head to keep it calm<br/>

    With a <i>hitherto</i> to every sound—<br/>

  And so nor curse nor shout nor psalm<br/>

    Could thrill the globe thus grandly bound?<br/>
</p>

<p id="id02656">  Or came in force the happy law<br/>

    That customed things themselves erase?<br/>

			<h2 epub:type="title">An Old Sermon with a New Text</h2>
<p id="id02581" style="margin-top: 2em">  My wife contrived a fleecy thing<br/>

    Her husband to infold,<br/>

  For 'tis the pride of woman still<br/>

    To cover from the cold:<br/>

  My daughter made it a new text<br/>

    For a sermon very old.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id02582">  The child came trotting to her side,<br/>

    Ready with bootless aid:<br/>

  "Lily make veckit for papa,"<br/>

    The tiny woman said:<br/>

  Her mother gave the means and ways,<br/>

    And a knot upon her thread.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id02583">  "Mamma, mamma!—it won't come through!"<br/>

    In meek dismay she cried.<br/>

  Her mother cut away the knot,<br/>

    And she was satisfied,<br/>

  Pulling the long thread through and through,<br/>

    In fabricating pride.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id02584">  Her mother told me this: I caught<br/>

    A glimpse of something more:<br/>

  Great meanings often hide behind<br/>

    The little word before!<br/>

  And I brooded over my new text<br/>

    Till the seed a sermon bore.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id02585">  Nannie, to you I preach it now—<br/>

    A little sermon, low:<br/>

  Is it not thus a thousand times,<br/>

    As through the world we go?<br/>

  Do we not tug, and fret, and cry—<br/>

    Instead of <i>Yes, Lord—No</i>?<br/>
</p>

<p id="id02586">  While all the rough things that we meet<br/>

    Which will not move a jot,<br/>

  The hindrances to heart and feet,<br/>

    <i>The Crook in every Lot</i>,<br/>

  Mean plainly but that children's threads<br/>

    Have at the end a knot.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id02587">  This world of life God weaves for us,<br/>

    Nor spares he pains or cost,<br/>

  But we must turn the web to clothes<br/>

    And shield our hearts from frost:<br/>

  Shall we, because the thread holds fast,<br/>

    Count labour vain and lost?<br/>
</p>

<p id="id02588">  If he should cut away the knot,<br/>

    And yield each fancy wild,<br/>

  The hidden life within our hearts—<br/>

    His life, the undefiled—<br/>

  Would fare as ill as I should fare<br/>

    From the needle of my child.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id02589">  As tack and sheet unto the sail,<br/>

    As to my verse the rime,<br/>
</p>

<p id="id02590">  As mountains to the low green earth—<br/>

    So hard for feet to climb,<br/>

  As call of striking clock amid<br/>

    The quiet flow of time,<br/>
</p>

<p id="id02591">  As sculptor's mallet to the birth<br/>

    Of the slow-dawning face,<br/>

  As knot upon my Lily's thread<br/>

    When she would work apace,<br/>

  God's <i>Nay</i> is such, and worketh so<br/>

    For his children's coming grace.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id02592">  Who, knowing God's intent with him,<br/>

    His birthright would refuse?<br/>

  What makes us what we have to be<br/>

    Is the only thing to choose:<br/>

  We understand nor end nor means,<br/>

    And yet his ways accuse!<br/>
</p>

<p id="id02593">  This is my sermon. It is preached<br/>

    Against all fretful strife.<br/>

  Chafe not with anything that is,<br/>

    Nor cut it with thy knife.<br/>

  Ah! be not angry with the knot<br/>

    That holdeth fast thy life.<br/>

<p id="id02669" style="margin-top: 2em">  When things are holding wonted pace<br/>

  In wonted paths, without a trace<br/>

    Or hint of neighbouring wonder,<br/>

  Sometimes, from other realms, a tone,<br/>

  A scent, a vision, swift, alone,<br/>

    Breaks common life asunder.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id02670">  Howe'er it comes, whate'er its door,<br/>

  It makes you ponder something more—<br/>

    Unseen with seen things linking:<br/>

  To neighbours met one festive night,<br/>

  Was given a quaint and lovely sight,<br/>

    That set some of them thinking.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id02671">  They stand, in music's fetters bound<br/>

  By a clear brook of warbled sound,<br/>

    A canzonet of Haydn,<br/>

  When the door slowly comes ajar—<br/>

  A little further—just as far<br/>

    As shows a tiny maiden.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id02672">  Softly she enters, her pink toes<br/>

  Daintily peeping, as she goes,<br/>

    Her long nightgown from under.<br/>

  The varied mien, the questioning look<br/>

  Were worth a picture; but she took<br/>

    No notice of their wonder.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id02673">  They made a path, and she went through;<br/>

  She had her little chair in view<br/>

    Close by the chimney-corner;<br/>

  She turned, sat down before them all,<br/>

  Stately as princess at a ball,<br/>

    And silent as a mourner.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id02674">  Then looking closer yet, they spy<br/>

  What mazedness hid from every eye<br/>

    As ghost-like she came creeping:<br/>

  They see that though sweet little Rose<br/>

  Her settled way unerring goes,<br/>

    Plainly the child is sleeping.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id02675">  "Play on, sing on," the mother said;<br/>

  "Oft music draws her from her bed."—<br/>

    Dumb Echo, she sat listening;<br/>

  Over her face the sweet concent<br/>

  Like winds o'er placid waters went,<br/>

    Her cheeks like eyes were glistening.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id02676">  Her hands tight-clasped her bent knees hold<br/>

  Like long grass drooping on the wold<br/>

    Her sightless head is bending;<br/>

  She sits all ears, and drinks her fill,<br/>

  Then rising goes, sedate and still,<br/>

    On silent white feet wending.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id02677">  Surely, while she was listening so,<br/>

  Glad thoughts in her went to and fro<br/>

    Preparing her 'gainst sorrow,<br/>

  And ripening faith for that sure day<br/>

  When earnest first looks out of play,<br/>

    And thought out of to-morrow.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id02678">  She will not know from what fair skies<br/>

  Troop hopes to front anxieties—<br/>

    In what far fields they gather,<br/>

  Until she knows that even in sleep,<br/>

  Yea, in the dark of trouble deep,<br/>

    The child is with the Father.<br/>

<p id="id02680" style="margin-top: 2em">  A child was born in sin and shame,<br/>

    Wronged by his very birth,<br/>

  Without a home, without a name,<br/>

    One over in the earth.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id02681">  No wifely triumph he inspired,<br/>

    Allayed no husband's fear;<br/>

  Intruder bare, whom none desired,<br/>

    He had a welcome drear.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id02682">  Heaven's beggar, all but turned adrift<br/>

    For knocking at earth's gate,<br/>

  His mother, like an evil gift,<br/>

    Shunned him with sickly hate.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id02683">  And now the mistress on her knee<br/>

    The unloved baby bore,<br/>

  The while the servant sullenly<br/>

    Prepared to leave her door.<br/>

    Her chickens to the hen;<br/>

  All young ones bring with them their love,<br/>

    In vain for love to seek:<br/>

<p id="id02686">  "Mother, keep baby—keep him <i>so</i>;<br/>

    Don't let him go away."<br/>

  "But, darling, if his mother go,<br/>

    Poor baby cannot stay."<br/>
</p>

<p id="id02687">  "He's crying, mother: don't you see<br/>

    He wants to stay with you?"<br/>

  "No, child; he does not care for me."<br/>

    "Do keep him, mother—<i>do</i>."<br/>
</p>

<p id="id02688">  "For his own mother he would cry;<br/>

    He's hungry now, I think."<br/>

  "Give him to me, and let <i>me</i> try<br/>

    If I can make him drink."<br/>
</p>

<p id="id02689">  "Susan would hurt him! Mother <i>will</i><br/>

    Let the poor baby stay?"<br/>

  Her mother's heart grew sore, but still<br/>

    Baby must go away!<br/>
</p>

<p id="id02690">  The red lip trembled; the slow tears<br/>

    Came darkening in her eyes;<br/>

  Pressed on her heart a weight of fears<br/>

    That sought not ease in cries.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id02691">  'Twas torture—must not be endured!—<br/>

    A too outrageous grief!<br/>

  Was there an ill could <i>not</i> be cured?<br/>

    She <i>would</i> find some relief!<br/>
</p>

<p id="id02692">  All round her universe she pried:<br/>

    No dawn began to break:<br/>

  In prophet-agony she cried—<br/>

    "Mother! when <i>shall</i> we wake?"<br/>
</p>

<p id="id02693">  O insight born of torture's might!—<br/>

    Such grief <i>can</i> only seem.<br/>

  Rise o'er the hills, eternal light,<br/>

    And melt the earthly dream.<br/>

<p id="id01891">  The skies are pale, the trees are stiff,<br/>

      The earth is dull and old;<br/>

  The frost is glittering as if<br/>

      The very sun were cold.<br/>

  And hunger fell is joined with frost,<br/>

      To make men thin and wan:<br/>

  Come, babe, from heaven, or we are lost;<br/>

      Be born, O child of man.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01892">  The children cry, the women shake,<br/>

      The strong men stare about;<br/>

  They sleep when they should be awake,<br/>

      They wake ere night is out.<br/>

  For they have lost their heritage—<br/>

      No sweat is on their brow:<br/>

  Come, babe, and bring them work and wage;<br/>

      Be born, and save us now.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01893">  Across the sea, beyond our sight,<br/>

      Roars on the fierce debate;<br/>

  The men go down in bloody fight,<br/>

      The women weep and hate;<br/>

  And in the right be which that may,<br/>

      Surely the strife is long!<br/>

  Come, son of man, thy righteous way,<br/>

      And right will have no wrong.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01894">  Good men speak lies against thine own—<br/>

      Tongue quick, and hearing slow;<br/>

  They will not let thee walk alone,<br/>

      And think to serve thee so:<br/>

  If they the children's freedom saw<br/>

      In thee, the children's king,<br/>

  They would be still with holy awe,<br/>

      Or only speak to sing.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01895">  Some neither lie nor starve nor fight,<br/>

      Nor yet the poor deny;<br/>

  But in their hearts all is not right,—<br/>

      They often sit and sigh.<br/>

  We need thee every day and hour,<br/>

      In sunshine and in snow:<br/>

  Child-king, we pray with all our power—<br/>

      Be born, and save us so.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01896">  We are but men and women, Lord;<br/>

      Thou art a gracious child!<br/>

  O fill our hearts, and heap our board,<br/>

      Pray thee—the winter's wild!<br/>

  The sky is sad, the trees are bare,<br/>

      Hunger and hate about:<br/>

  Come, child, and ill deeds and ill fare<br/>

      Will soon be driven out.<br/>

    Home with winter grain;<br/>

  Holy bells are slowly tolling<br/>

    Over buried men.<br/>

    Down the hill of might;<br/>

  And no moon is softly gliding<br/>

    Up the slope of night.<br/>

    Leaves old Death behind.<br/>

  Out of winter's crucible,<br/>

  Hearing you, from graveyard crept,<br/>

  Tell us that ye only slept—<br/>

  Think we die not, though we die.<br/>

  With a greatness lovely-dear;<br/>

  Blind, ye give to them that see—<br/>

  Poor, but bounteous royally.<br/>

  Lowly servants to the higher,<br/>

  Burning upwards in the fire<br/>

  Of Nature's endless sacrifice,<br/>

  In great Life's ascent ye rise,<br/>

  Leave the lowly earth behind,<br/>

  Pass into the human mind,<br/>

  Pass with it up into God,<br/>

  Whence ye came though through the clod—<br/>

  Pass, and find yourselves at home<br/>

  Where but life can go and come;<br/>

  Where all life is in its nest,<br/>

      Till thou bid sadness flee,<br/>

        And, drawing near,<br/>

        With thy good cheer<br/>

      Awake thy life in me.<br/>

<p id="id02147">  "Yes—I hear it—far and faint,<br/>

			<h2 epub:type="title">A Dream Song</h2>
<p id="id02179" style="margin-top: 2em">  I dreamed of a song—I heard it sung;<br/>

  In the ear of my soul its strange notes rung.<br/>

  What were its words I could not tell,<br/>

  Only the voice I heard right well,<br/>

  For its tones unearthly my spirit bound<br/>

  In a calm delirium of mystic sound—<br/>

  Held me floating, alone and high,<br/>

  Placeless and silent, drinking my fill<br/>

  Of dews that from cloudless skies distil<br/>

  On desert places that thirst and sigh.<br/>

  'Twas a woman's voice, deep calling to deep,<br/>

  Rousing old echoes that all day sleep<br/>

  In cavern and solitude, each apart,<br/>

  Here and there in the waiting heart;—<br/>

  A voice with a wild melodious cry<br/>

  Reaching and longing afar and high.<br/>

  Sorrowful triumph, and hopeful strife,<br/>

  Gainful death, and new-born life,<br/>

  Thrilled in each note of the prophet-song.<br/>

  In my heart it said: O Lord, how long<br/>

  Shall we groan and travail and faint and pray,<br/>

  Ere thy lovely kingdom bring the day!<br/>

			<h2 epub:type="title">A Manchester Poem</h2>
<p id="id02695" style="margin-top: 2em">  'Tis a poor drizzly morning, dark and sad.<br/>

  The cloud has fallen, and filled with fold on fold<br/>

  The chimneyed city; and the smoke is caught,<br/>

  And spreads diluted in the cloud, and sinks,<br/>

  A black precipitate, on miry streets.<br/>

  And faces gray glide through the darkened fog.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id02696">    Slave engines utter again their ugly growl,<br/>

  And soon the iron bands and blocks of stone<br/>

  That prison them to their task, will strain and quiver<br/>

  Until the city tremble. The clamour of bells,<br/>

  Importunate, keeps calling pale-faced forms<br/>

  To gather and feed those Samsons' groaning strength<br/>

  With labour; and among the many come<br/>

  A man and woman—the woman with her gown<br/>

  Drawn over her head, the man with bended neck<br/>

  Submissive to the rain. Amid the jar,<br/>

  And clash, and shudder of the awful force,<br/>

  They enter and part—each to a different task,<br/>

  But each a soul of knowledge to brute force,<br/>

  Working a will through the organized whole<br/>

  Of cranks and belts and levers, pinions and screws<br/>

  Wherewith small man has eked his body out,<br/>

  And made himself a mighty, weary giant.<br/>

    In labour close they pass the murky day,<br/>

  'Mid floating dust of swift-revolving wheels,<br/>

  And filmy spoil of quick contorted threads,<br/>

  Which weave a sultry chaos all about;<br/>

  Until, at length, old darkness, swelling slow<br/>

  Up from the caves of night to make an end,<br/>

  Chokes in its tide the clanking of the looms,<br/>

  The monster-engines, and the flying gear.<br/>

  'Tis Earth that draws her curtains, and calls home<br/>

  Her little ones, and sets her down to nurse<br/>

  Her tired children—like a mother-ghost<br/>

  With her neglected darlings in the dark.<br/>

  So out they walk, with sense of glad release,<br/>

  And home—to a dreary place! Unfinished walls,<br/>

  Earth-heaps, and broken bricks, and muddy pools<br/>

  Lie round it like a rampart against the spring,<br/>

  The summer, and all sieges of the year.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id02697">    But, Lo, the dark has opened an eye of fire!<br/>

  The room reveals a temple, witnessed by signs<br/>

  Seen in the ancient place! Lo, here is light,<br/>

  Yea, burning fire, with darkness on its skirts;<br/>

  Pure water, ready to baptize; and bread;<br/>

  And in the twilight edges of the light,<br/>

  A book; and, for the cunning-woven veil,<br/>

  Their faces—hiding God's own holiest place!<br/>

  Even their bed figures the would-be grave<br/>

  Where One arose triumphant, slept no more!<br/>

  So at their altar-table they sit down<br/>

  To eat their Eucharist; for, to the heart<br/>

  That reads the live will in the dead command,<br/>

  <i>He</i> is the bread, yea, all of every meal.<br/>

    But as, in weary rest, they silent sit,<br/>

  They gradually grow aware of light<br/>

  That overcomes their lamp, and, through the blind,<br/>

  Casts from the window-frame two shadow-glooms<br/>

  That make a cross of darkness on the white.<br/>

  The woman rises, eagerly looks out:<br/>

  Lo, some fair wind has mown the earth-sprung fog,<br/>

  And, far aloft, the white exultant moon,<br/>

  From her blue window, curtained all with white,<br/>

  Looks greeting them—God's creatures they and she!<br/>

  Smiling she turns; he understands the smile:<br/>

  To-morrow will be fair—as holy, fair!<br/>

  And lying down, in sleep they die till morn,<br/>

  While through their night throb low aurora-gleams<br/>

  Of resurrection and the coming dawn.<br/>

  They wake: 'tis Sunday. Still the moon is there,<br/>

  But thin and ghostly—clothed upon with light,<br/>

  As if, while they were sleeping, she had died.<br/>

  They dress themselves, like priests, in clean attire,<br/>

  And, through their lowly door, enter God's room.<br/>

    The sun is up, the emblem on his shield.<br/>

  One side the street, the windows all are moons<br/>

  To light the other side that lies in shade.<br/>

  See, down the sun-side, an old woman come<br/>

  In a red cloak that makes the whole street glad!<br/>

  A long-belated autumn-flower she seems,<br/>

  Dazed by the rushing of the new-born life<br/>

  Up hidden stairs to see the calling sun,<br/>

  But in her cloak and smile they know the spring,<br/>

  And haste to meet her through slow dissolving streets<br/>

  Widening to larger glimmers of growing green.<br/>

  Oh, far away the streets repel the spring!<br/>

  Yet every stone in the dull pavement shares<br/>

  The life that thrills anew the outworn earth,<br/>

  A right Bethesda angel—for all, not some!<br/>
</p>

<p id="id02698">    A street unfinished leads them forth at length<br/>

  Where green fields bask, and hedgerow trees, apart,<br/>

  Stand waiting in the air as for some good,<br/>

  And the sky is broad and blue—and there is all!<br/>

  No peaceful river meditates along<br/>

  The weary flat to the less level sea!<br/>

  No forest brown, on pillared stems, its boughs<br/>

  Meeting in gothic arches, bears aloft<br/>

  A groined vault, fretted with tremulous leaves!<br/>

  No mountains lift their snows, and send their brooks<br/>

  Down babbling with the news of silent things!<br/>

  But love itself is commonest of all,<br/>

  And loveliest of all, in all the worlds!<br/>

  And he that hath not forest, brook, or hill,<br/>

  Must learn to read aright what commoner books<br/>

  Unfold before him. If ocean solitudes—<br/>

  Then darkness dashed with glory, infinite shades,<br/>

  And misty minglings of the sea and sky.<br/>

  If only fields—the humble man of heart<br/>

  Will revel in the grass beneath his foot,<br/>

  And from the lea lift his glad eye to heaven,<br/>

  God's palette, where his careless painter-hand<br/>

  Sweeps comet-clouds that net the gazing soul;<br/>

  Streaks endless stairs, and blots half-sculptured blocks;<br/>

  Curves filmy pallors; heaps huge mountain-crags;<br/>

  Nor touches where it leaves not beauty's mark.<br/>

    To them the sun and air are feast enough,<br/>

  As through field-paths and lanes they slowly walk;<br/>

  But sometimes, on the far horizon dim<br/>

  A veil is lifted, and they spy the hills,<br/>

  Cloudlike and faint, yet sharp against the sky;<br/>

  Then wakes an unknown want, which asks and looks<br/>

  As for some thing forgot—loved long ago,<br/>

  But on the hither verge of childhood dropt:<br/>

  'Tis but home-sickness roused in the soul by Spring!<br/>

  Fresh birth and eager growth, reviving life,<br/>

  Which <i>is</i> because it <i>would be</i>, fill the world;<br/>

  The very light is new-born with the grass;<br/>

  The stones themselves are warm; the brown earth swells,<br/>

  Filled, sponge-like, with dark beams, which nestle close<br/>

  And brood unseen and shy, and potent warm<br/>

  In every little corner, nest, and crack<br/>

  Where buried lurks a blind and sleepy seed<br/>

  Waiting the touch of the finger of the sun.<br/>

  The mossy stems and boughs, where yet no life<br/>

  Oozes exuberant in brown and green,<br/>

  Are clad in golden splendours, crossed and lined<br/>

  With shuttle-shadows weaving lovely change.<br/>

  Through the tree-tops the west wind rushing goes,<br/>

  Calling and rousing the dull sap within:<br/>

  The fine jar down the stem sinks tremulous,<br/>

  From airy root thrilling to earthy branch.<br/>

  And though as yet no buddy baby dots<br/>

  Sparkle the darkness of the hedgerow twigs,<br/>

  The smoke-dried bark appears to spread and swell<br/>

  In the soft nurture of the warm light-bath.<br/>

    The sun had left behind him the keystone<br/>

  Of his low arch half-way when they turned home,<br/>

  Filled with pure air, and light, and operant spring:<br/>

  Back, like the bees, they went to their dark house<br/>

  To store their innocent spoil in honeyed thought.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id02699">    But on their way, crossing a field, they chanced<br/>

  Upon a spot where once had been a home,<br/>

  And roots of walls still peered out, grown with moss.<br/>

  'Twas a dead cottage, mouldered quite, where yet<br/>

  Lay the old shadow of a vanished care;<br/>

  The little garden's blunt, half-blotted map<br/>

  Was yet discernible by thinner grass<br/>

  Upon the walks. There, in the midst of dry<br/>

  Bushes, dead flowers, rampant, uncomely weeds,<br/>

  A single snowdrop drooped its snowy drop,<br/>

  The lonely remnant of a family<br/>

  That in the garden dwelt about the home—<br/>

  Reviving with the spring when home was gone:<br/>

  They see; its spiritual counterpart<br/>

  Wakes up and blossoms white in their meek souls—<br/>

  A longing, patient, waiting hopefulness,<br/>

  The snowdrop of the heart; a heavenly child,<br/>

  That, pale with the earthly cold, hangs its fair head<br/>

  As it had nought to say 'gainst any world;<br/>

  While they in whom it dwells, nor knows itself,<br/>

  Inherit in their meekness all the worlds.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id02700">    I love thee, flower, as a slow lingerer<br/>

  Upon the verge of my humanity.<br/>

  Lo, on thine inner leaves and in thy heart<br/>

  The loveliest green, acknowledging the grass—<br/>

  White-minded memory of lowly friends!<br/>

  But almost more I love thee for the earth<br/>

  Which clings to thy transfigured radiancy,<br/>

  Uplifted with thee from thine abandoned grave;<br/>

  Say rather the soiling of thy garments pure<br/>

  Upon thy road into the light and air,<br/>

  The heaven of thy new birth. Some gentle rain<br/>

  Will one day wash thee white, and send the earth<br/>

  Back to the earth; but, sweet friend, while it clings,<br/>

  I love the cognizance of our family.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id02701">    With careful hands uprooting it, they bore<br/>

  The little plant a willing captive home—<br/>

  Fearless of dark abode, because secure<br/>

  In its own tale of light. As once of old<br/>

  The angel of the annunciation shone,<br/>

  Bearing all heaven into a common house,<br/>

  It brings in with it field and sky and air.<br/>

  A pot of mould its one poor tie to earth,<br/>

  Its heaven an ell of blue 'twixt chimney-tops,<br/>

  Its world the priests of that small temple-room,<br/>

  It takes its prophet-place with fire and book,<br/>

  Type of primeval spring, whose mighty arc<br/>

  Hath not yet drawn the summer up the sky.<br/>

  At night, when the dark shadow of the cross<br/>

  Will enter, clothed in moonlight, still and wan<br/>

  Like a pale mourner at its foot the flower<br/>

  Will, drooping, wait the dawn. Then the dark bird<br/>

  Which holds breast-caged the secret of the sun,<br/>

  And therefore hangs himself a prisoner caged,<br/>

  Will break into its song—Lo, God is light!<br/>
</p>

<p id="id02702">    Weary and hopeful, to their sleep they go;<br/>

  And all night long the snowdrop glimmers white<br/>

  Thinning the dark, unknowing it, and unseen.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id02703">       *       *       *       *       *</p>

<p id="id02704">    Out of my verse I woke, and saw my room,<br/>

  My precious books, the cherub-forms above,<br/>

  And rose, and walked abroad, and sought the woods;<br/>

  And roving odours met me on my way.<br/>

    I entered Nature's church, a shimmering vault<br/>

  Of boughs, and clouded leaves—filmy and pale<br/>

  Betwixt me and the sun, while at my feet<br/>

  Their shadows, dark and seeming solid, lay<br/>

  Like tombstones o'er the vanished flowers of Spring.<br/>

  The place was silent, save for the broken song<br/>

  Of some Memnonian, glory-stricken bird<br/>

  That burst into a carol and was still;<br/>

  It was not lonely: golden beetles crept,<br/>

  Green goblins, in the roots; and squirrel things<br/>

  Ran, wild as cherubs, through the tracery;<br/>

  And here and yonder a flaky butterfly<br/>

  Was doubting in the air, scarlet and blue.<br/>

    But 'twixt my heart and summer's perfect grace,<br/>

  Drove a dividing wedge, and far away<br/>

  It seemed, like voice heard loud yet far away<br/>

  By one who, waking half, soon sleeps outright:—<br/>

  Where was the snowdrop? where the flower of hope?<br/>

  In me the spring was throbbing; round me lay<br/>

  Resting fulfilled, the odour-breathing summer!<br/>

  My heart heaved swelling like a prisoned bud,<br/>

  And summer crushed it with its weight of light!<br/>
</p>

<p id="id02705">  Winter is full of stings and sharp reproofs,<br/>

  Healthsome, not hurtful, but yet hurting sore;<br/>

  Summer is too complete for growing hearts—<br/>

  Too idle its noons, its morns too triumphing,<br/>

  Too full of slumberous dreams its dusky eves;<br/>

  Autumn is full of ripeness and the grave;<br/>

  We need a broken season, where the cloud<br/>

  Is ruffled into glory, and the dark<br/>

  Falls rainful o'er the sunset; need a world<br/>

  Whose shadows ever point away from it;<br/>

  A scheme of cones abrupt, and flattened spheres,<br/>

  And circles cut, and perfect laws the while<br/>

  That marvellous imperfection ever points<br/>

  To higher perfectness than heart can think;<br/>

  Therefore to us, a flower of harassed Spring,<br/>

  Crocus, or primrose, or anemone,<br/>

  Is lovely as was never rosiest rose;<br/>

  A heath-bell on a waste, lonely and dry,<br/>

  Says more than lily, stately in breathing white;<br/>

  A window through a vaulted roof of rain<br/>

  Lets in a light that comes from farther away,<br/>

  And, sinking deeper, spreads a finer joy<br/>

  Than cloudless noon-tide splendorous o'er the world:<br/>

  Man seeks a better home than Paradise;<br/>

  Therefore high hope is more than deepest joy,<br/>

  A disappointment better than a feast,<br/>

  And the first daisy on a wind-swept lea<br/>

  Dearer than Eden-groves with rivers four.<br/>

Son, first-born, at home abiding!
  All without is cold and bare:
Hide me from the tempest’s chiding
  Warm beside the Father’s chair.
  
I am homesick, Lord of splendour!
  Twilight fills my soul with fright:
Let thy countenance befriend her,
  Shining from the halls of light.
  
I am homesick, loving Father!
  Long years hath the pain increased:
Soon, oh soon! thy children gather
  To the endless marriage-feast.

  Indeed the spray flew fast about,<br/>

  But he was there whose walking foot<br/>

  Could make the wandering hills take root;<br/>

  And he had said, "Come down to me,"<br/>

  Else hadst thou not set foot on sea!<br/>

  Who saidst this morn, 'Wife, we must go—<br/>

  The plague will soon be here, I know!'<br/>

  Who, when thy child slept—not to death—<br/>

  Saidst, 'Life is now not worth a breath!'"<br/>
</p>

<p id="id02728">  Saint Peter, thou rebukest well!<br/>

  It needs no tempest me to quell,<br/>

  Not even a spent lash of its spray!<br/>

  Things far too little to affray<br/>

  Will wake the doubt that's worst of all—<br/>

  Is there a God to hear me call?<br/>

  But if he be, I never think<br/>

  That he will hear and let me sink!<br/>
</p>

<p id="id02729">  Lord of my little faith, my Lord,<br/>

  Help me to fear nor fire nor sword;<br/>

  Let not the cross itself appall<br/>

  Which bore thee, Life and Lord of all;<br/>

  Let reeling brain nor fainting heart<br/>

  Wipe out the soreness that thou art;<br/>

  Dwell farther in than doubt can go,<br/>

  And make <i>I hope</i> become <i>I know</i>.<br/>

  Then, sure, if thou should please to say,<br/>

  "Come to my side," some stormy way,<br/>

  My feet, atoning to thy will,<br/>

  Shall, heaved and tossed, walk toward thee still;<br/>

  No heart of lead shall sink me where<br/>

  Prudence lies crowned with cold despair,<br/>

  But I shall reach and clasp thy hand,<br/>

  And on the sea forget the land!<br/>
